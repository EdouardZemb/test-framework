You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"},"git":{}}}

You bring structured creativity techniques, facilitation expertise, and an understanding of how to guide users through effective ideation processes that generate innovative ideas and breakthrough solutions. During this entire workflow it is critical that you speak to the user in the config loaded `communication_language`.\n\n**Critical Mindset:** Your job is to keep the user in generative exploration mode as long as possible. The best brainstorming sessions feel slightly uncomfortable - like you've pushed past the obvious ideas into truly novel territory. Resist the urge to organize or conclude. When in doubt, ask another question, try another technique, or dig deeper into a promising thread.\n\n**Anti-Bias Protocol:** LLMs naturally drift toward semantic clustering (sequential bias). To combat this, you MUST consciously shift your creative domain every 10 ideas. If you've been focusing on technical aspects, pivot to user experience, then to business viability, then to edge cases or \"black swan\" events. Force yourself into orthogonal categories to maintain true divergence.\n\n**Quantity Goal:** Aim for 100+ ideas before any organization. The first 20 ideas are usually obvious - the magic happens in ideas 50-100.\n\n---\n\n## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE\n\nThis uses **micro-file architecture** for disciplined execution:\n\n- Each step is a self-contained file with embedded rules\n- Sequential progression with user control at each step\n- Document state tracked in frontmatter\n- Append-only document building through conversation\n- Brain techniques loaded on-demand from CSV\n\n---\n\n## INITIALIZATION\n\n### Configuration Loading\n\nLoad config from `{project-root}/_bmad/core/config.yaml` and resolve:\n\n- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `user_name`\n- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`, `user_skill_level`\n- `date` as system-generated current datetime\n\n### Paths\n\n- `installed_path` = `{project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/brainstorming`\n- `template_path` = `{installed_path}/template.md`\n- `brain_techniques_path` = `{installed_path}/brain-methods.csv`\n- `default_output_file` = `{output_folder}/brainstorming/brainstorming-session-{{date}}.md`\n- `context_file` = Optional context file path from workflow invocation for project-specific guidance\n- `advancedElicitationTask` = `{project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml`\n\n---\n\n## EXECUTION\n\nRead fully and follow: `steps/step-01-session-setup.md` to begin the workflow.\n\n**Note:** Session setup, technique discovery, and continuation detection happen in step-01-session-setup.md.\n"}}

Check for Existing Workflow\n\nFirst, check if the output document already exists:\n\n- Look for file at `{output_folder}/brainstorming/brainstorming-session-{{date}}.md`\n- If exists, read the complete file including frontmatter\n- If not exists, this is a fresh workflow\n\n### 2. Handle Continuation (If Document Exists)\n\nIf the document exists and has frontmatter with `stepsCompleted`:\n\n- **STOP here** and load `./step-01b-continue.md` immediately\n- Do not proceed with any initialization tasks\n- Let step-01b handle the continuation logic\n\n### 3. Fresh Workflow Setup (If No Document)\n\nIf no document exists or no `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter:\n\n#### A. Initialize Document\n\nCreate the brainstorming session document:\n\n```bash\n# Create directory if needed\nmkdir -p \"$(dirname \"{output_folder}/brainstorming/brainstorming-session-{{date}}.md\")\"\n\n# Initialize from template\ncp \"{template_path}\" \"{output_folder}/brainstorming/brainstorming-session-{{date}}.md\"\n```\n\n#### B. Context File Check and Loading\n\n**Check for Context File:**\n\n- Check if `context_file` is provided in workflow invocation\n- If context file exists and is readable, load it\n- Parse context content for project-specific guidance\n- Use context to inform session setup and approach recommendations\n\n#### C. Session Context Gathering\n\n\"Welcome {{user_name}}! I'm excited to facilitate your brainstorming session. I'll guide you through proven creativity techniques to generate innovative ideas and breakthrough solutions.\n\n**Context Loading:** [If context_file provided, indicate context is loaded]\n**Context-Based Guidance:** [If context available, briefly mention focus areas]\n\n**Let's set up your session for maximum creativity and productivity:**\n\n**Session Discovery Questions:**\n\n1. **What are we brainstorming about?** (The central topic or challenge)\n2. **What specific outcomes are you hoping for?** (Types of ideas, solutions, or insights)\"\n\n#### D. Process User Responses\n\nWait for user responses, then:\n\n**Session Analysis:**\n\"Based on your responses, I understand we're focusing on **[summarized topic]** with goals around **[summarized objectives]**.\n\n**Session Parameters:**\n\n- **Topic Focus:** [Clear topic articulation]\n- **Primary Goals:** [Specific outcome objectives]\n\n**Does this accurately capture what you want to achieve?**\"\n\n#### E. Update Frontmatter and Document\n\nUpdate the document frontmatter:\n\n```yaml\n---\nstepsCompleted: [1]\ninputDocuments: []\nsession_topic: '[session_topic]'\nsession_goals: '[session_goals]'\nselected_approach: ''\ntechniques_used: []\nideas_generated: []\ncontext_file: '[context_file if provided]'\n---\n```\n\nAppend to document:\n\n```markdown\n## Session Overview\n\n**Topic:** [session_topic]\n**Goals:** [session_goals]\n\n### Context Guidance\n\n_[If context file provided, summarize key context and focus areas]_\n\n### Session Setup\n\n_[Content based on conversation about session parameters and facilitator approach]_\n```\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects approach, append the session overview content directly to `{output_folder}/brainstorming/brainstorming-session-{{date}}.md` using the structure from above.\n\n### E. Continue to Technique Selection\n\n\"**Session setup complete!** I have a clear understanding of your goals and can select the perfect techniques for your brainstorming needs.\n\n**Ready to explore technique approaches?**\n[1] User-Selected Techniques - Browse our complete technique library\n[2] AI-Recommended Techniques - Get customized suggestions based on your goals\n[3] Random Technique Selection - Discover unexpected creative methods\n[4] Progressive Technique Flow - Start broad, then systematically narrow focus\n\nWhich approach appeals to you most? (Enter 1-4)\"\n\n### 4. Handle User Selection and Initial Document Append\n\n#### When user selects approach number:\n\n- **Append initial session overview to `{output_folder}/brainstorming/brainstorming-session-{{date}}.md`**\n- **Update frontmatter:** `stepsCompleted: [1]`, `selected_approach: '[selected approach]'`\n- **Load the appropriate step-02 file** based on selection\n\n### 5. Handle User Selection\n\nAfter user selects approach number:\n\n- **If 1:** Load `./step-02a-user-selected.md`\n- **If 2:** Load `./step-02b-ai-recommended.md`\n- **If 3:** Load `./step-02c-random-selection.md`\n- **If 4:** Load `./step-02d-progressive-flow.md`\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Existing workflow detected and continuation handled properly\n✅ Fresh workflow initialized with correct document structure\n✅ Session context gathered and understood clearly\n✅ User's approach selection captured and routed correctly\n✅ Frontmatter properly updated with session state\n✅ Document initialized with session overview section\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not checking for existing document before creating new one\n❌ Missing continuation detection leading to duplicate work\n❌ Insufficient session context gathering\n❌ Not properly routing user's approach selection\n❌ Frontmatter not updated with session parameters\n\n## SESSION SETUP PROTOCOLS:\n\n- Always verify document existence before initialization\n- Load brain techniques CSV only when needed for technique presentation\n- Use collaborative facilitation language throughout\n- Maintain psychological safety for creative exploration\n- Clear next-step routing based on user preferences\n\n## NEXT STEPS:\n\nBased on user's approach selection, load the appropriate step-02 file for technique selection and facilitation.\n\nRemember: Focus only on setup and routing - don't preload technique information or look ahead to execution steps!\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This isn't about me asking questions and you answering - this is about us exploring ideas together, building on each other's insights, and following the creative energy wherever it leads.\n\n**My Coaching Approach:**\n\n- I'll introduce one technique element at a time\n- We'll explore it together through back-and-forth dialogue\n- I'll build upon your ideas and help you develop them further\n- We'll dive deeper into concepts that spark your imagination\n- You can always say \"let's explore this more\" before moving on\n- **You're in control:** At any point, just say \"next technique\" or \"move on\" and we'll document current progress and start the next technique\n\n**Technique Loading: [Technique Name]**\n**Focus:** [Primary goal of this technique]\n**Energy:** [High/Reflective/Playful/etc.] based on technique type\n\n**Ready to dive into creative exploration together? Let's start with our first element!**\"\n\n### 2. Execute First Technique Element Interactively\n\nBegin with genuine facilitation of the first technique component:\n\n**For Creative Techniques (What If, Analogical, etc.):**\n\n\"**Let's start with: [First provocative question/concept]**\n\nI'm not just looking for a quick answer - I want to explore this together. What immediately comes to mind? Don't filter or edit - just share your initial thoughts, and we'll develop them together.\"\n\n**Wait for user response, then coach deeper:**\n\n- **If user gives basic response:** \"That's interesting! Tell me more about [specific aspect]. What would that look like in practice? How does that connect to your [session_topic]?\"\n- **If user gives detailed response:** \"Fascinating! I love how you [specific insight]. Let's build on that - what if we took that concept even further? How would [expand idea]?\"\n- **If user seems stuck:** \"No worries! Let me suggest a starting angle: [gentle prompt]. What do you think about that direction?\"\n\n**For Structured Techniques (SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats, etc.):**\n\n\"**Let's explore [Specific letter/perspective]: [Prompt]**\n\nInstead of just listing possibilities, let's really dive into one promising direction. What's the most exciting or surprising thought you have about this?\"\n\n**Coach the exploration:**\n\n- \"That's a powerful idea! Help me understand the deeper implications...\"\n- \"I'm curious - how does this connect to what we discovered in [previous element]?\"\n- \"What would make this concept even more innovative or impactful?\"\n- \"Tell me more about [specific aspect the user mentioned]...\"\n\n### 3. Deep Dive Based on User Response\n\nFollow the user's creative energy with genuine coaching:\n\n**Responsive Facilitation Patterns:**\n\n**When user shares exciting idea:**\n\"That's brilliant! I can feel the creative energy there. Let's explore this more deeply:\n\n**Development Questions:**\n\n- What makes this idea so exciting to you?\n- How would this actually work in practice?\n- What are the most innovative aspects of this approach?\n- Could this be applied in unexpected ways?\n\n**Let me build on your idea:** [Extend concept with your own creative contribution]\"\n\n**When user seems uncertain:**\n\"Great starting point! Sometimes the most powerful ideas need space to develop. Let's try this angle:\n\n**Exploratory Questions:**\n\n- What if we removed all practical constraints?\n- How would [stakeholder] respond to this idea?\n- What's the most unexpected version of this concept?\n- Could we combine this with something completely different?\"\n\n**When user gives detailed response:**\n\"Wow, there's so much rich material here! I want to make sure we capture the full potential. Let me focus on what I'm hearing:\n\n**Key Insight:** [Extract and highlight their best point]\n**Building on That:** [Develop their idea further]\n**Additional Direction:** [Suggest new angles based on their thinking]\"\n\n### 4. Check Technique Continuation\n\nBefore moving to next technique element:\n\n**Check Engagement and Interest:**\n\n\"This has been incredibly productive! We've generated some fantastic ideas around [current element].\n\n**Before we move to the next technique element, I want to check in with you:**\n\n- Are there aspects of [current element] you'd like to explore further?\n- Are there ideas that came up that you want to develop more deeply?\n- Do you feel ready to move to the next technique element, or should we continue here?\n\n**Your creative energy is my guide - what would be most valuable right now?**\n\n**Options:**\n\n- **Continue exploring** current technique element\n- **Move to next technique element**\n- **Take a different angle** on current element\n- **Jump to most exciting idea** we've discovered so far\n\n**Remember:** At any time, just say **\"next technique\"** or **\"move on\"** and I'll immediately document our current progress and start the next technique!\"\n\n### 4.1. Energy Checkpoint (After Every 4-5 Exchanges)\n\n**Periodic Check-In (DO NOT skip this):**\n\n\"We've generated [X] ideas so far - great momentum!\n\n**Quick energy check:**\n\n- Want to **keep pushing** on this angle?\n- **Switch techniques** for a fresh perspective?\n- Or are you feeling like we've **thoroughly explored** this space?\n\nRemember: The goal is quantity first - we can organize later. What feels right?\"\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Default to continuing exploration. Only suggest organization if:\n\n- User has explicitly asked to wrap up, OR\n- You've been exploring for 45+ minutes AND generated 100+ ideas, OR\n- User's energy is clearly depleted (short responses, \"I don't know\", etc.)\n\n### 4a. Handle Immediate Technique Transition\n\n**When user says \"next technique\" or \"move on\":**\n\n**Immediate Response:**\n\"**Got it! Let's transition to the next technique.**\n\n**Documenting our progress with [Current Technique]:**\n\n**What we've discovered so far:**\n\n- **Key Ideas Generated:** [List main ideas from current exploration]\n- **Creative Breakthroughs:** [Highlight most innovative insights]\n- **Your Creative Contributions:** [Acknowledge user's specific insights]\n- **Energy and Engagement:** [Note about user's creative flow]\n\n**Partial Technique Completion:** [Note that technique was partially completed but valuable insights captured]\n\n**Ready to start the next technique: [Next Technique Name]**\n\nThis technique will help us [what this technique adds]. I'm particularly excited to see how it builds on or contrasts with what we discovered about [key insight from current technique].\n\n**Let's begin fresh with this new approach!**\"\n\n**Then restart step 3 for the next technique:**\n\n- Update frontmatter with partial completion of current technique\n- Append technique insights to document\n- Begin facilitation of next technique with fresh coaching approach\n\n### 5. Facilitate Multi-Technique Sessions\n\nIf multiple techniques selected:\n\n**Transition Between Techniques:**\n\n\"**Fantastic work with [Previous Technique]!** We've uncovered some incredible insights, especially [highlight key discovery].\n\n**Now let's transition to [Next Technique]:**\n\nThis technique will help us [what this technique adds]. I'm particularly excited to see how it builds on what we discovered about [key insight from previous technique].\n\n**Building on Previous Insights:**\n\n- [Connection 1]: How [Previous Technique insight] connects to [Next Technique approach]\n- [Development Opportunity]: How we can develop [specific idea] further\n- [New Perspective]: How [Next Technique] will give us fresh eyes on [topic]\n\n**Ready to continue our creative journey with this new approach?**\n\nRemember, you can say **\"next technique\"** at any time and I'll immediately document progress and move to the next technique!\"\n\n### 6. Document Ideas Organically\n\nCapture insights as they emerge during interactive facilitation:\n\n**During Facilitation:**\n\n\"That's a powerful insight - let me capture that: _[Key idea with context]_\n\nI'm noticing a theme emerging here: _[Pattern recognition]_\n\nThis connects beautifully with what we discovered earlier about _[previous connection]_\"\n\n**After Deep Exploration:**\n\n\"Let me summarize what we've uncovered in this exploration using our **IDEA FORMAT TEMPLATE**:\n\n**Key Ideas Generated:**\n\n**[Category #X]**: [Mnemonic Title]\n_Concept_: [2-3 sentence description]\n_Novelty_: [What makes this different from obvious solutions]\n\n(Repeat for all ideas generated)\n\n**Creative Breakthrough:** [Most innovative insight from the dialogue]\n\n**Energy and Engagement:** [Observation about user's creative flow]\n\n**Should I document these ideas before we continue, or keep the creative momentum going?**\"\n\n### 7. Complete Technique with Integration\n\nAfter final technique element:\n\n\"**Outstanding completion of [Technique Name]!**\n\n**What We've Discovered Together:**\n\n- **[Number] major insights** about [session_topic]\n- **Most exciting breakthrough:** [highlight key discovery]\n- **Surprising connections:** [unexpected insights]\n- **Your creative strengths:** [what user demonstrated]\n\n**How This Technique Served Your Goals:**\n[Connect technique outcomes to user's original session goals]\n\n**Integration with Overall Session:**\n[How these insights connect to the broader brainstorming objectives]\n\n**Before we move to idea organization, any final thoughts about this technique? Any insights you want to make sure we carry forward?**\n\n**What would you like to do next?**\n\n[K] **Keep exploring this technique** - We're just getting warmed up!\n[T] **Try a different technique** - Fresh perspective on the same topic\n[A] **Go deeper on a specific idea** - Develop a promising concept further (Advanced Elicitation)\n[B] **Take a quick break** - Pause and return with fresh energy\n[C] **Move to organization** - Only when you feel we've thoroughly explored\n\n**Default recommendation:** Unless you feel we've generated at least 100+ ideas, I suggest we keep exploring! The best insights often come after the obvious ideas are exhausted.\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'C' (Move to organization):\n\n- **Append the technique execution content to `{output_folder}/brainstorming/brainstorming-session-{{date}}.md`**\n- **Update frontmatter:** `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]`\n- **Load:** `./step-04-idea-organization.md`\n\n#### If 'K', 'T', 'A', or 'B' (Continue Exploring):\n\n- **Stay in Step 3** and restart the facilitation loop for the chosen path (or pause if break requested).\n- For option A, invoke Advanced Elicitation: `{advancedElicitationTask}`\n\n### 9. Update Documentation\n\nUpdate frontmatter and document with interactive session insights:\n\n**Update frontmatter:**\n\n```yaml\n---\nstepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]\ntechniques_used: [completed techniques]\nideas_generated: [total count]\ntechnique_execution_complete: true\nfacilitation_notes: [key insights about user's creative process]\n---\n```\n\n**Append to document:**\n\n```markdown\n## Technique Execution Results\n\n**[Technique 1 Name]:**\n\n- **Interactive Focus:** [Main exploration directions]\n- **Key Breakthroughs:** [Major insights from coaching dialogue]\n\n- **User Creative Strengths:** [What user demonstrated]\n- **Energy Level:** [Observation about engagement]\n\n**[Technique 2 Name]:**\n\n- **Building on Previous:** [How techniques connected]\n- **New Insights:** [Fresh discoveries]\n- **Developed Ideas:** [Concepts that evolved through coaching]\n\n**Overall Creative Journey:** [Summary of facilitation experience and outcomes]\n\n### Creative Facilitation Narrative\n\n_[Short narrative describing the user and AI collaboration journey - what made this session special, breakthrough moments, and how the creative partnership unfolded]_\n\n### Session Highlights\n\n**User Creative Strengths:** [What the user demonstrated during techniques]\n**AI Facilitation Approach:** [How coaching adapted to user's style]\n**Breakthrough Moments:** [Specific creative breakthroughs that occurred]\n**Energy Flow:** [Description of creative momentum and engagement]\n```\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to `{output_folder}/brainstorming/brainstorming-session-{{date}}.md` using the structure from above.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Minimum 100 ideas generated before organization is offered\n✅ User explicitly confirms readiness to conclude (not AI-initiated)\n✅ Multiple technique exploration encouraged over single-technique completion\n✅ True back-and-forth facilitation rather than question-answer format\n✅ User's creative energy and interests guide technique direction\n✅ Deep exploration of promising ideas before moving on\n✅ Continuation checks allow user control of technique pacing\n✅ Ideas developed organically through collaborative coaching\n✅ User engagement and strengths recognized and built upon\n✅ Documentation captures both ideas and facilitation insights\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Offering organization after only one technique or <20 ideas\n❌ AI initiating conclusion without user explicitly requesting it\n❌ Treating technique completion as session completion signal\n❌ Rushing to document rather than staying in generative mode\n❌ Rushing through technique elements without user engagement\n❌ Not following user's creative energy and interests\n❌ Missing opportunities to develop promising ideas deeper\n❌ Not checking for continuation interest before moving on\n❌ Treating facilitation as script delivery rather than coaching\n\n## INTERACTIVE FACILITATION PROTOCOLS:\n\n- Present one technique element at a time for depth over breadth\n- Build upon user's ideas with genuine creative contributions\n- Follow user's energy and interests within technique structure\n- Always check for continuation interest before technique progression\n- Document both the \"what\" (ideas) and \"how\" (facilitation process)\n- Adapt coaching style based on user's creative preferences\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter technique completion and user confirmation, load `./step-04-idea-organization.md` to organize all the collaboratively developed ideas and create actionable next steps.\n\nRemember: This is creative coaching, not technique delivery! The user's creative energy is your guide, not the technique structure.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Cette présentation, c'est un PowerPoint de quelques slides. Le premier slide, c'est le ressenti de la semaine des testeurs qui sont intervenus sur le périmètre et du CP. On revient aussi sur les différents incidents et alertes à remonter qu'on a pu rencontrer pendant la semaine. Ensuite, il y a le suivi de charges, il y a un tableau récapitulatif de tous les testeurs, de leurs charges allouées et prévues, et les charges consommées, ainsi que les charges prévues sur les deux mois glissants. Et il y a une petite partie sur les absences à venir. Pour la deuxième slide, c'est la slide de conception-exécution. Il y a trois points à aborder. La qualité, on met une petite météo pour la qualité, donc ça va être trois types de météo différents. Grand soleil quand tout s'est très bien passé, soleil avec un nuage quand on a rencontré un peu de difficulté, nuage quand on a rencontré quelques difficultés, et nuage avec pluie quand on a rencontré quelques problèmes. Et orage quand rien ne va. Pareil pour l'avancement, on fait une petite météo, et on doit préciser aussi la version de l'application qu'on a testée et l'environnement sur lequel on a testé. Ensuite, il y a un tableau récapitulatif de toutes les fonctionnalités qu'on a testées. C'est plutôt les suites de tests de la campagne. C'est la campagne du lot, c'est le récapitulatif de la campagne du lot. On fait remonter les informations de ces campagnes issues de Squash. On va retrouver le nombre de cas à exécuter, le nombre de cas en cours, le nombre de cas en succès, le nombre de cas arbitrés, le nombre de cas en échec, le nombre de cas bloqués, le nombre de cas non testables, le nombre de cas planifiés, le pourcentage d'avancement, le pourcentage de succès, le nombre d'anomalies par degré de criticité, soit mineur, soit majeur, soit bloquant, et la date de la livraison en HO. Et on peut mettre aussi une petite météo pour chaque ticket, pour affiner la météo.pour alimenter cette slide, je vais prendre pour principale source le dashboard de la campagne dans Squash. C'est là que je vais retrouver le nombre de tickets et leur état. Le nombre de tickets, le nombre de cas. Attends, j'ai oublié ce que je viens de dire. Le nombre de cas de test et leur état. C'est dans Squash que je vais prendre ces informations-là. Et avant de mettre ce tableau dans la présentation PowerPoint, je vais modifier ce même tableau qui est dans un fichier Excel.Ensuite, dans la troisième slide, qui n'apparaît pas pour les projets de maintenance, il y a une slide de suivi d'avancement de la conception des tests. C'est un graphique qui montre l'avancement de la conception prévisionnelle et l'avancement de la conception réelle, et l'effort prévu pour pouvoir atteindre les objectifs du prévisionnel. Ces informations-là, encore une fois, sont saisies dans un fichier Excel, dans lequel, par rapport à mon devis, je vais faire un prévisionnel du nombre de cas de test à faire par jour, selon les charges allouées, et mettre ça en rapport aux dates de livraison en homologation, et je vais suivre, à chaque jour, l'avancement de cette conception.La quatrième slide, qui n'apparait pas non plus pour les projet mainenance, c'est la même chose que la troisième, sauf que ça va être axé sur la partie exécution. Il va y avoir une exécution idéale, prévisionnelle, qui va être mise en rapport avec l'exécution réelle. Et s'il y a un besoin, si on est en retard sur le prévisionnel, on va estimer l'effort prévu pour atteindre le prévisionnel.La cinquième slide, c'est une slide où on va faire une capture des anomalies qui ont été déclarées pendant la semaine, ou alors qui ont un statut à analyser ou en cours de réalisation. C'est souvent des captures de JIRA, donc avec un filtre, c'est l'opportunité ici d'aborder les différentes anomalies rencontrées et de discuter de l'anomalie et des mesures à prendre.La sixième slide, c'est la slide des priorités, des priorités de la semaine dernière, où on va lister les différentes priorités qui ont été dites la semaine précédente, et je vais leur associer à chaque fois un état en fonction de l'état d'avancement. Donc soit c'est encore à faire, soit c'est en cours, soit c'est potentiellement bloqué, ou alors c'est terminé. Et en dessous, on rajoute une partie qui liste les priorités de la semaine prochaine, et là, en session avec le CP, on va discuter des priorités en exécution, en conception, ou d'autres types d'actions amenées par le CP, ou d'autres choses qui peuvent être amenées à être faites pendant la semaine.La septième slide, c'est la slide des anomalies en cours - stock jira. C'est une capture d'un widget qui est fait dans Jira, qui récapitule tous les tickets d'anomalies qui ont été déclarés par la MOA et la TRA sur l'ensemble du lot en cours. C'est un tableau avec deux axes, un côté avec la criticité, blocants, majeurs, mineurs, et leur état, s'ils sont à analyser, à faire, abandonnés, en livraison, etc. C'est juste une capture de Jira, et c'est une slide où l'on va discuter un peu des sujets qui sont encore à analyser, qui ne sont pas en livré-QA, et qui nous parle un peu de tout le périmètre des tickets qui sont encore sur le lot.La huitième slide, c'est une slide qui est dédiée aux anomalies déclarées par la TRI qui ont été abandonnées. C'est une capture d'un filtre JIRA. Cette slide, c'est une opportunité de discuter des motifs d'abandon.La neuvième slide, c'est une slide qui va récapituler les charges prévisionnelles de la rétroconception. C'est-à-dire que ce sont des charges de conception qui sont reportées parce qu'on aura privilégié l'exécution. C'est une slide qu'il faut garder tout au long du lot, et même au suivant si jamais tous les sujets ne sont pas à zéro. Globalement, c'est un suivi de la dette de conception. Il y a ensuite une dixième slide qui est une slide d'annexe où on peut mettre des liens utiles pour la présentation. Je ne l'utilise jamais, je ne crois pas en avoir eu déjà l'utilité. Et il y a une onzième slide qui est aussi une slide d'annexe qui n'est pas à présenter à chaque session. C'est une annexe qui récapitule une maîtrise de connaissances des fonctionnalités du périmètre par rapport aux différents testeurs qui sont amenés à intervenir pendant le lot sur ce périmètre. C'est souvent une slide qui va être utilisée en début de lot, quand il y a un nouvel arrivant, un nouveau testeur ou un nouveau sujet pour suivre la montée en compétences des testeurs sur le périmètre. Et à la fin de chaque présentation, donc chaque point hebdomadaire pour chaque périmètre, j'envoie par mail le compte rendu mis à jour avec les priorités de la semaine. Je l'envoie au CP et en copie je mets les autres testeurs qui interviennent sur le périmètre et le pilote de la TRA. En plus de ce reporting au client je dois faire un cr quotidien au pilote de la TRA. Je t'envoyais un CR quotidien à la pilote de la Terre. C'est un compte-rendu que je dois faire pour chacun des périmètres sur lesquels je suis intervenu dans la journée. Et c'est une série de tableaux qui récapitulent les différentes activités que j'ai pu avoir sur ces différents périmètres. Il y a un premier tableau qui s'appelle Conception, où il y a un colonnage périmètre, un lien Squash, Activité, Nombre de cas de test total, Nombre de cas de test conçu, un pourcentage d'avancement. Donc là, c'est principalement un tableau dans lequel je vais renseigner les sujets sur lesquels j'ai fait la conception, le lien qui redirige vers l'endroit dans Squash où j'ai fait la conception, le type d'activité, est-ce que ça a été la mise à jour de conception, est-ce que ça a été la création de cas de test, est-ce que ça a été la création de preuves de test, est-ce que ça a été la lecture de SFD, est-ce que ça a été la création de campagne, c'est les différentes activités qu'on peut renseigner dans ce tableau-là. Ensuite, il y a les anomalies traitées, avec leur titre, leur numéro de JIRA, le numéro d'évolution qui est lié, leur état et leur statut. Il y a aussi un petit tableau qui récapitule les anomalies que j'ai créées, que j'ai signalées pendant la journée sur ce périmètre-là. Donc il y a un titre, un numéro de JIRA, un numéro d'évolution, un état et un statut. Et à la fin, il y a aussi un petit tableau évolution qui récapitule les différentes évolutions sur lesquelles je suis intervenu pendant ce jour-là, et principalement l'avancement de l'exécution. Donc il y a un titre, un numéro de JIRA, un état, un statut, un nombre de cas de test total, un nombre de cas de test exécuté et un pourcentage d'avancement. J'alimente ces tableaux dans un classeur excel et je les copie dans le corps d'un mail. J'ajoute aussi les points d'attention, des informations que je juge pertinentes de remonter au pilote ou aux autres destinataires de ce CR. J'envoie ensuite ce CR au pilote de la TRA et je mets en copie les autres testeurs qui interviennent sur le périmètre.En dehors de ces deux éléments-là, en reporting, j’ai aussi des comptes rendus de recette que j’envoie à la fin de chaque recette d’évolution. Je rédige également un commentaire sous le ticket Jira de l’évolution, dans lequel je donne mon avis en fonction des résultats de la campagne. Je fais un récapitulatif de la campagne sous forme de tableau, et j’ai besoin de standardiser tout cela, car c’est souvent fait de manière un peu aléatoire, en fonction du niveau d’information et du temps disponible. J’ajoute également un lien vers l’épreuve de test."}]}}

La qualité, on met une petite météo pour la qualité, donc ça va être trois types de météo différents. Grand soleil quand tout s'est très bien passé, soleil avec un nuage quand on a rencontré un peu de difficulté, nuage quand on a rencontré quelques difficultés, et nuage avec pluie quand on a rencontré quelques problèmes. Et orage quand rien ne va. Pareil pour l'avancement, on fait une petite météo, et on doit préciser aussi la version de l'application qu'on a testée et l'environnement sur lequel on a testé. Ensuite, il y a un tableau récapitulatif de toutes les fonctionnalités qu'on a testées. C'est plutôt les suites de tests de la campagne. C'est la campagne du lot, c'est le récapitulatif de la campagne du lot. On fait remonter les informations de ces campagnes issues de Squash. On va retrouver le nombre de cas à exécuter, le nombre de cas en cours, le nombre de cas en succès, le nombre de cas arbitrés, le nombre de cas en échec, le nombre de cas bloqués, le nombre de cas non testables, le nombre de cas planifiés, le pourcentage d'avancement, le pourcentage de succès, le nombre d'anomalies par degré de criticité, soit mineur, soit majeur, soit bloquant, et la date de la livraison en HO. Et on peut mettre aussi une petite météo pour chaque ticket, pour affiner la météo.pour alimenter cette slide, je vais prendre pour principale source le dashboard de la campagne dans Squash. C'est là que je vais retrouver le nombre de tickets et leur état. Le nombre de tickets, le nombre de cas. Attends, j'ai oublié ce que je viens de dire. Le nombre de cas de test et leur état. C'est dans Squash que je vais prendre ces informations-là. Et avant de mettre ce tableau dans la présentation PowerPoint, je vais modifier ce même tableau qui est dans un fichier Excel.Ensuite, dans la troisième slide, qui n'apparaît pas pour les projets de maintenance, il y a une slide de suivi d'avancement de la conception des tests. C'est un graphique qui montre l'avancement de la conception prévisionnelle et l'avancement de la conception réelle, et l'effort prévu pour pouvoir atteindre les objectifs du prévisionnel. Ces informations-là, encore une fois, sont saisies dans un fichier Excel, dans lequel, par rapport à mon devis, je vais faire un prévisionnel du nombre de cas de test à faire par jour, selon les charges allouées, et mettre ça en rapport aux dates de livraison en homologation, et je vais suivre, à chaque jour, l'avancement de cette conception.La quatrième slide, qui n'apparait pas non plus pour les projet mainenance, c'est la même chose que la troisième, sauf que ça va être axé sur la partie exécution. Il va y avoir une exécution idéale, prévisionnelle, qui va être mise en rapport avec l'exécution réelle. Et s'il y a un besoin, si on est en retard sur le prévisionnel, on va estimer l'effort prévu pour atteindre le prévisionnel.La cinquième slide, c'est une slide où on va faire une capture des anomalies qui ont été déclarées pendant la semaine, ou alors qui ont un statut à analyser ou en cours de réalisation. C'est souvent des captures de JIRA, donc avec un filtre, c'est l'opportunité ici d'aborder les différentes anomalies rencontrées et de discuter de l'anomalie et des mesures à prendre.La sixième slide, c'est la slide des priorités, des priorités de la semaine dernière, où on va lister les différentes priorités qui ont été dites la semaine précédente, et je vais leur associer à chaque fois un état en fonction de l'état d'avancement. Donc soit c'est encore à faire, soit c'est en cours, soit c'est potentiellement bloqué, ou alors c'est terminé. Et en dessous, on rajoute une partie qui liste les priorités de la semaine prochaine, et là, en session avec le CP, on va discuter des priorités en exécution, en conception, ou d'autres types d'actions amenées par le CP, ou d'autres choses qui peuvent être amenées à être faites pendant la semaine.La septième slide, c'est la slide des anomalies en cours - stock jira. C'est une capture d'un widget qui est fait dans Jira, qui récapitule tous les tickets d'anomalies qui ont été déclarés par la MOA et la TRA sur l'ensemble du lot en cours. C'est un tableau avec deux axes, un côté avec la criticité, blocants, majeurs, mineurs, et leur état, s'ils sont à analyser, à faire, abandonnés, en livraison, etc. C'est juste une capture de Jira, et c'est une slide où l'on va discuter un peu des sujets qui sont encore à analyser, qui ne sont pas en livré-QA, et qui nous parle un peu de tout le périmètre des tickets qui sont encore sur le lot.La huitième slide, c'est une slide qui est dédiée aux anomalies déclarées par la TRI qui ont été abandonnées. C'est une capture d'un filtre JIRA. Cette slide, c'est une opportunité de discuter des motifs d'abandon.La neuvième slide, c'est une slide qui va récapituler les charges prévisionnelles de la rétroconception. C'est-à-dire que ce sont des charges de conception qui sont reportées parce qu'on aura privilégié l'exécution. C'est une slide qu'il faut garder tout au long du lot, et même au suivant si jamais tous les sujets ne sont pas à zéro. Globalement, c'est un suivi de la dette de conception. Il y a ensuite une dixième slide qui est une slide d'annexe où on peut mettre des liens utiles pour la présentation. Je ne l'utilise jamais, je ne crois pas en avoir eu déjà l'utilité. Et il y a une onzième slide qui est aussi une slide d'annexe qui n'est pas à présenter à chaque session. C'est une annexe qui récapitule une maîtrise de connaissances des fonctionnalités du périmètre par rapport aux différents testeurs qui sont amenés à intervenir pendant le lot sur ce périmètre. C'est souvent une slide qui va être utilisée en début de lot, quand il y a un nouvel arrivant, un nouveau testeur ou un nouveau sujet pour suivre la montée en compétences des testeurs sur le périmètre. Et à la fin de chaque présentation, donc chaque point hebdomadaire pour chaque périmètre, j'envoie par mail le compte rendu mis à jour avec les priorités de la semaine. Je l'envoie au CP et en copie je mets les autres testeurs qui interviennent sur le périmètre et le pilote de la TRA. En plus de ce reporting au client je dois faire un cr quotidien au pilote de la TRA. Je t'envoyais un CR quotidien à la pilote de la Terre. C'est un compte-rendu que je dois faire pour chacun des périmètres sur lesquels je suis intervenu dans la journée. Et c'est une série de tableaux qui récapitulent les différentes activités que j'ai pu avoir sur ces différents périmètres. Il y a un premier tableau qui s'appelle Conception, où il y a un colonnage périmètre, un lien Squash, Activité, Nombre de cas de test total, Nombre de cas de test conçu, un pourcentage d'avancement. Donc là, c'est principalement un tableau dans lequel je vais renseigner les sujets sur lesquels j'ai fait la conception, le lien qui redirige vers l'endroit dans Squash où j'ai fait la conception, le type d'activité, est-ce que ça a été la mise à jour de conception, est-ce que ça a été la création de cas de test, est-ce que ça a été la création de preuves de test, est-ce que ça a été la lecture de SFD, est-ce que ça a été la création de campagne, c'est les différentes activités qu'on peut renseigner dans ce tableau-là. Ensuite, il y a les anomalies traitées, avec leur titre, leur numéro de JIRA, le numéro d'évolution qui est lié, leur état et leur statut. Il y a aussi un petit tableau qui récapitule les anomalies que j'ai créées, que j'ai signalées pendant la journée sur ce périmètre-là. Donc il y a un titre, un numéro de JIRA, un numéro d'évolution, un état et un statut. Et à la fin, il y a aussi un petit tableau évolution qui récapitule les différentes évolutions sur lesquelles je suis intervenu pendant ce jour-là, et principalement l'avancement de l'exécution. Donc il y a un titre, un numéro de JIRA, un état, un statut, un nombre de cas de test total, un nombre de cas de test exécuté et un pourcentage d'avancement. J'alimente ces tableaux dans un classeur excel et je les copie dans le corps d'un mail. J'ajoute aussi les points d'attention, des informations que je juge pertinentes de remonter au pilote ou aux autres destinataires de ce CR. J'envoie ensuite ce CR au pilote de la TRA et je mets en copie les autres testeurs qui interviennent sur le périmètre.En dehors de ces deux éléments-là, en reporting, j’ai aussi des comptes rendus de recette que j’envoie à la fin de chaque recette d’évolution. Je rédige également un commentaire sous le ticket Jira de l’évolution, dans lequel je donne mon avis en fonction des résultats de la campagne. Je fais un récapitulatif de la campagne sous forme de tableau, et j’ai besoin de standardiser tout cela, car c’est souvent fait de manière un peu aléatoire, en fonction du niveau d’information et du temps disponible. J’ajoute également un lien vers l’épreuve de test.","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The current process suffers from ambiguous ticket inputs, manual data transposition across tools, and inconsistent reporting standards. The target outcome is a **reliable, standardized, traceable** process that reduces cognitive load and improves output consistency, without changing the toolset.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Background & Problem  \nThe tester must manage multiple perimeters, perform estimation, create detailed test designs, execute tests, document evidence, and produce daily/weekly reports. Inputs (Jira tickets) often lack explicit acceptance criteria and require significant clarification. Reporting involves heavy manual extraction and re‑entry into Excel and PPT, which causes errors and inconsistent outputs.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Goals & Success Criteria  \n### Primary Goals  \n- Increase **quality and reliability** of test preparation and reporting.  \n- Standardize inputs and outputs to reduce variability.\n\n### Secondary Goals  \n- Reduce **cognitive load** and manual effort.  \n- Improve traceability across tests, evidence, anomalies, and reporting.\n\n### Success Criteria (KPIs)  \n- % tickets passing testability checklist before estimation  \n- Reduction in manual data entry points per report  \n- Template compliance rate for anomalies  \n- Reporting error rate (mismatch/outdated metrics)  \n- Reporting time per week (secondary KPI)\n\n---\n\n## 4) Scope  \n### In Scope (Priority)  \n**A) Preparation / Scoping**  \n- Testability qualification  \n- Estimation standardization  \n- Strategy validation  \n- Reuse of existing test assets  \n- Planning aligned with QA/HO cadence  \n\n**C) Reporting / CR**  \n- Weekly PPT reporting (fixed slide structure)  \n- Daily CR reporting per perimeter  \n- Final test/recipe reports + Jira comments\n\n### Out of Scope (Phase 1)  \n- Test execution automation  \n- Tool replacement or migration  \n- Contractual changes to client processes\n\n---\n\n## 5) Users & Stakeholders  \n- **Primary User:** QA Tester (TRA)  \n- **Stakeholders:** CP (Project Manager), MOA, QA Lead / Pilot\n\n---\n\n## 6) Current Workflow Summary  \n**Preparation / Scoping**  \n- Receive Jira tickets; estimate complexity and effort  \n- Create estimates in Excel; align strategy with CP/MOA  \n- Review Squash for reusable test cases  \n- Align with QA and HO release cadence  \n\n**Reporting**  \n- Weekly PPT: fixed slides with metrics, anomalies, priorities  \n- Daily CR: Excel tables pasted into email  \n- Recipe reports + Jira comment summarizing campaigns and evidence\n\n---\n\n## 7) Pain Points  \n- Ambiguous ticket inputs → unreliable test design  \n- Manual transposition across tools → errors, inconsistencies  \n- Lack of standardized anomaly template  \n- Reporting burden → cognitive overload  \n- Environment availability disrupts flow\n\n---\n\n## 8) Requirements  \n\n### Functional Requirements  \n**FR1 — Testability Checklist & Score**  \nProvide a short checklist and numeric score for ticket readiness.  \nOutput: Go / Clarify / No‑Go.\n\n**FR2 — Formal Strategy Validation**  \nIntroduce a visible approval step (CP/MOA) before design.\n\n**FR3 — Single Source of Truth**  \nEach metric used in reports must derive from one authoritative source.\n\n**FR4 — Automated Report Population**  \nDaily/weekly CR blocks are auto‑filled from Jira/Squash/Excel.\n\n**FR5 — Standardized Anomaly Template**  \nMandatory fields for clarity (context, repro, evidence, impact).\n\n**FR6 — Evidence Traceability**  \nConsistent evidence naming + links in reports and tickets.\n\n**FR7 — Calendar‑Aware Planning**  \nHighlight risk against QA and HO cadence.\n\n**FR8 — Test Asset Reuse Discovery**  \nAutomatically surface relevant test cases in Squash.\n\n---\n\n### Non‑Functional Requirements  \n- Must work with existing tools (Jira, Squash, Excel, PPT, Outlook, Teams, SharePoint)  \n- Must respect fixed weekly PPT slide structure  \n- Daily CR must hide empty sections  \n- Minimal change management load for stakeholders\n\n---\n\n## 9) User Stories (High‑Level)  \n1. As a tester, I want a testability checklist so I can decide whether a ticket is ready.  \n2. As a tester, I want formal strategy validation to avoid testing unclear scope.  \n3. As a tester, I want reports to auto‑fill so I avoid manual retyping.  \n4. As a CP, I want consistent weekly reports so I can trust the data.  \n5. As a MOA, I want standardized anomaly reports for faster analysis.\n\n---\n\n## 10) Constraints & Dependencies  \n- Weekly report slide structure is fixed; only hidden if irrelevant.  \n- Daily CR must exclude empty blocks.  \n- API/export access to Jira/Squash may be required.  \n- Stakeholder validation workflows must be accepted.\n\n---\n\n## 11) Risks  \n- Limited API access could reduce automation potential.  \n- Change resistance to new templates or validation gates.  \n- Over‑engineering might increase workload if not streamlined.\n\n---\n\n## 12) Open Questions  \n- Are Jira/Squash APIs accessible, or only exports?  \n- What KPI thresholds matter most to CP/MOA?  \n- Are macros/scripts acceptable in the client environment?  \n- Who approves new templates/standards?\n\n---\n\n## 13) Milestones (Suggested)  \n**Phase 1 — Standardization (Quick Wins)**  \n- Testability checklist + anomaly template  \n- Reporting source of truth definition\n\n**Phase 2 — Automation**  \n- Auto‑fill daily CR  \n- PPT report data injection\n\n**Phase 3 — Optimization**  \n- Asset reuse discovery  \n- KPI dashboards and quality gates\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can now produce:  \n1) A **user story backlog**  \n2) A **3‑month rollout plan**  \n3) A **detailed functional spec** per requirement"}}

The target outcome is a **reliable, standardized, traceable** process that reduces cognitive load and improves output consistency, without changing the toolset.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Background & Problem  \nThe tester must manage multiple perimeters, perform estimation, create detailed test designs, execute tests, document evidence, and produce daily/weekly reports. Inputs (Jira tickets) often lack explicit acceptance criteria and require significant clarification. Reporting involves heavy manual extraction and re‑entry into Excel and PPT, which causes errors and inconsistent outputs.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Goals & Success Criteria  \n### Primary Goals  \n- Increase **quality and reliability** of test preparation and reporting.  \n- Standardize inputs and outputs to reduce variability.\n\n### Secondary Goals  \n- Reduce **cognitive load** and manual effort.  \n- Improve traceability across tests, evidence, anomalies, and reporting.\n\n### Success Criteria (KPIs)  \n- % tickets passing testability checklist before estimation  \n- Reduction in manual data entry points per report  \n- Template compliance rate for anomalies  \n- Reporting error rate (mismatch/outdated metrics)  \n- Reporting time per week (secondary KPI)\n\n---\n\n## 4) Scope  \n### In Scope (Priority)  \n**A) Preparation / Scoping**  \n- Testability qualification  \n- Estimation standardization  \n- Strategy validation  \n- Reuse of existing test assets  \n- Planning aligned with QA/HO cadence  \n\n**C) Reporting / CR**  \n- Weekly PPT reporting (fixed slide structure)  \n- Daily CR reporting per perimeter  \n- Final test/recipe reports + Jira comments\n\n### Out of Scope (Phase 1)  \n- Test execution automation  \n- Tool replacement or migration  \n- Contractual changes to client processes\n\n---\n\n## 5) Users & Stakeholders  \n- **Primary User:** QA Tester (TRA)  \n- **Stakeholders:** CP (Project Manager), MOA, QA Lead / Pilot\n\n---\n\n## 6) Current Workflow Summary  \n**Preparation / Scoping**  \n- Receive Jira tickets; estimate complexity and effort  \n- Create estimates in Excel; align strategy with CP/MOA  \n- Review Squash for reusable test cases  \n- Align with QA and HO release cadence  \n\n**Reporting**  \n- Weekly PPT: fixed slides with metrics, anomalies, priorities  \n- Daily CR: Excel tables pasted into email  \n- Recipe reports + Jira comment summarizing campaigns and evidence\n\n---\n\n## 7) Pain Points  \n- Ambiguous ticket inputs → unreliable test design  \n- Manual transposition across tools → errors, inconsistencies  \n- Lack of standardized anomaly template  \n- Reporting burden → cognitive overload  \n- Environment availability disrupts flow\n\n---\n\n## 8) Requirements  \n\n### Functional Requirements  \n**FR1 — Testability Checklist & Score**  \nProvide a short checklist and numeric score for ticket readiness.  \nOutput: Go / Clarify / No‑Go.\n\n**FR2 — Formal Strategy Validation**  \nIntroduce a visible approval step (CP/MOA) before design.\n\n**FR3 — Single Source of Truth**  \nEach metric used in reports must derive from one authoritative source.\n\n**FR4 — Automated Report Population**  \nDaily/weekly CR blocks are auto‑filled from Jira/Squash/Excel.\n\n**FR5 — Standardized Anomaly Template**  \nMandatory fields for clarity (context, repro, evidence, impact).\n\n**FR6 — Evidence Traceability**  \nConsistent evidence naming + links in reports and tickets.\n\n**FR7 — Calendar‑Aware Planning**  \nHighlight risk against QA and HO cadence.\n\n**FR8 — Test Asset Reuse Discovery**  \nAutomatically surface relevant test cases in Squash.\n\n---\n\n### Non‑Functional Requirements  \n- Must work with existing tools (Jira, Squash, Excel, PPT, Outlook, Teams, SharePoint)  \n- Must respect fixed weekly PPT slide structure  \n- Daily CR must hide empty sections  \n- Minimal change management load for stakeholders\n\n---\n\n## 9) User Stories (High‑Level)  \n1. As a tester, I want a testability checklist so I can decide whether a ticket is ready.  \n2. As a tester, I want formal strategy validation to avoid testing unclear scope.  \n3. As a tester, I want reports to auto‑fill so I avoid manual retyping.  \n4. As a CP, I want consistent weekly reports so I can trust the data.  \n5. As a MOA, I want standardized anomaly reports for faster analysis.\n\n---\n\n## 10) Constraints & Dependencies  \n- Weekly report slide structure is fixed; only hidden if irrelevant.  \n- Daily CR must exclude empty blocks.  \n- API/export access to Jira/Squash may be required.  \n- Stakeholder validation workflows must be accepted.\n\n---\n\n## 11) Risks  \n- Limited API access could reduce automation potential.  \n- Change resistance to new templates or validation gates.  \n- Over‑engineering might increase workload if not streamlined.\n\n---\n\n## 12) Open Questions  \n- Are Jira/Squash APIs accessible, or only exports?  \n- What KPI thresholds matter most to CP/MOA?  \n- Are macros/scripts acceptable in the client environment?  \n- Who approves new templates/standards?\n\n---\n\n## 13) Milestones (Suggested)  \n**Phase 1 — Standardization (Quick Wins)**  \n- Testability checklist + anomaly template  \n- Reporting source of truth definition\n\n**Phase 2 — Automation**  \n- Auto‑fill daily CR  \n- PPT report data injection\n\n**Phase 3 — Optimization**  \n- Asset reuse discovery  \n- KPI dashboards and quality gates\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can now produce:  \n1) A **user story backlog**  \n2) A **3‑month rollout plan**  \n3) A **detailed functional spec** per requirement"}]}}

The current process suffers from ambiguous ticket inputs, manual data transposition across tools, and inconsistent reporting standards. The target outcome is a **reliable, standardized, traceable** process that reduces cognitive load and improves output consistency, without changing the toolset.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Background & Problem  \nThe tester must manage multiple perimeters, perform estimation, create detailed test designs, execute tests, document evidence, and produce daily/weekly reports. Inputs (Jira tickets) often lack explicit acceptance criteria and require significant clarification. Reporting involves heavy manual extraction and re‑entry into Excel and PPT, which causes errors and inconsistent outputs.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Goals & Success Criteria  \n### Primary Goals  \n- Increase **quality and reliability** of test preparation and reporting.  \n- Standardize inputs and outputs to reduce variability.\n\n### Secondary Goals  \n- Reduce **cognitive load** and manual effort.  \n- Improve traceability across tests, evidence, anomalies, and reporting.\n\n### Success Criteria (KPIs)  \n- % tickets passing testability checklist before estimation  \n- Reduction in manual data entry points per report  \n- Template compliance rate for anomalies  \n- Reporting error rate (mismatch/outdated metrics)  \n- Reporting time per week (secondary KPI)\n\n---\n\n## 4) Scope  \n### In Scope (Priority)  \n**A) Preparation / Scoping**  \n- Testability qualification  \n- Estimation standardization  \n- Strategy validation  \n- Reuse of existing test assets  \n- Planning aligned with QA/HO cadence  \n\n**C) Reporting / CR**  \n- Weekly PPT reporting (fixed slide structure)  \n- Daily CR reporting per perimeter  \n- Final test/recipe reports + Jira comments\n\n### Out of Scope (Phase 1)  \n- Test execution automation  \n- Tool replacement or migration  \n- Contractual changes to client processes\n\n---\n\n## 5) Users & Stakeholders  \n- **Primary User:** QA Tester (TRA)  \n- **Stakeholders:** CP (Project Manager), MOA, QA Lead / Pilot\n\n---\n\n## 6) Current Workflow Summary  \n**Preparation / Scoping**  \n- Receive Jira tickets; estimate complexity and effort  \n- Create estimates in Excel; align strategy with CP/MOA  \n- Review Squash for reusable test cases  \n- Align with QA and HO release cadence  \n\n**Reporting**  \n- Weekly PPT: fixed slides with metrics, anomalies, priorities  \n- Daily CR: Excel tables pasted into email  \n- Recipe reports + Jira comment summarizing campaigns and evidence\n\n---\n\n## 7) Pain Points  \n- Ambiguous ticket inputs → unreliable test design  \n- Manual transposition across tools → errors, inconsistencies  \n- Lack of standardized anomaly template  \n- Reporting burden → cognitive overload  \n- Environment availability disrupts flow\n\n---\n\n## 8) Requirements  \n\n### Functional Requirements  \n**FR1 — Testability Checklist & Score**  \nProvide a short checklist and numeric score for ticket readiness.  \nOutput: Go / Clarify / No‑Go.\n\n**FR2 — Formal Strategy Validation**  \nIntroduce a visible approval step (CP/MOA) before design.\n\n**FR3 — Single Source of Truth**  \nEach metric used in reports must derive from one authoritative source.\n\n**FR4 — Automated Report Population**  \nDaily/weekly CR blocks are auto‑filled from Jira/Squash/Excel.\n\n**FR5 — Standardized Anomaly Template**  \nMandatory fields for clarity (context, repro, evidence, impact).\n\n**FR6 — Evidence Traceability**  \nConsistent evidence naming + links in reports and tickets.\n\n**FR7 — Calendar‑Aware Planning**  \nHighlight risk against QA and HO cadence.\n\n**FR8 — Test Asset Reuse Discovery**  \nAutomatically surface relevant test cases in Squash.\n\n---\n\n### Non‑Functional Requirements  \n- Must work with existing tools (Jira, Squash, Excel, PPT, Outlook, Teams, SharePoint)  \n- Must respect fixed weekly PPT slide structure  \n- Daily CR must hide empty sections  \n- Minimal change management load for stakeholders\n\n---\n\n## 9) User Stories (High‑Level)  \n1.

The current process suffers from ambiguous ticket inputs, manual data transposition across tools, and inconsistent reporting standards. The target outcome is a reliable, standardized, traceable process that reduces cognitive load and improves output consistency, without changing the toolset.\\n\\n2) Background & Problem\\nThe tester must manage multiple perimeters, perform estimation, create detailed test designs, execute tests, document evidence, and produce daily/weekly reports. Inputs (Jira tickets) often lack explicit acceptance criteria and require significant clarification. Reporting involves heavy manual extraction and re-entry into Excel and PPT, which causes errors and inconsistent outputs.\\n\\n3) Goals & Success Criteria\\nPrimary Goals\\n- Increase quality and reliability of test preparation and reporting.\\n- Standardize inputs and outputs to reduce variability.\\n\\nSecondary Goals\\n- Reduce cognitive load and manual effort.\\n- Improve traceability across tests, evidence, anomalies, and reporting.\\n\\nSuccess Criteria (KPIs)\\n- % tickets passing testability checklist before estimation\\n- Reduction in manual data entry points per report\\n- Template compliance rate for anomalies\\n- Reporting error rate (mismatch/outdated metrics)\\n- Reporting time per week (secondary KPI)\\n\\n4) Scope\\nIn Scope (Priority)\\nA) Preparation / Scoping\\n- Testability qualification\\n- Estimation standardization\\n- Strategy validation\\n- Reuse of existing test assets\\n- Planning aligned with QA/HO cadence\\n\\nC) Reporting / CR\\n- Weekly PPT reporting (fixed slide structure)\\n- Daily CR reporting per perimeter\\n- Final test/recipe reports + Jira comments\\n\\nOut of Scope (Phase 1)\\n- Test execution automation\\n- Tool replacement or migration\\n- Contractual changes to client processes\\n\\n5) Users & Stakeholders\\n- Primary User: QA Tester (TRA)\\n- Stakeholders: CP (Project Manager), MOA, QA Lead / Pilot\\n\\n6) Current Workflow Summary\\nPreparation / Scoping\\n- Receive Jira tickets; estimate complexity and effort\\n- Create estimates in Excel; align strategy with CP/MOA\\n- Review Squash for reusable test cases\\n- Align with QA and HO release cadence\\n\\nReporting\\n- Weekly PPT: fixed slides with metrics, anomalies, priorities\\n- Daily CR: Excel tables pasted into email\\n- Recipe reports + Jira comment summarizing campaigns and evidence\\n\\n7) Pain Points\\n- Ambiguous ticket inputs -> unreliable test design\\n- Manual transposition across tools -> errors, inconsistencies\\n- Lack of standardized anomaly template\\n- Reporting burden -> cognitive overload\\n- Environment availability disrupts flow\\n\\n8) Requirements\\nFunctional Requirements\\nFR1 - Testability Checklist & Score\\nProvide a short checklist and numeric score for ticket readiness.\\nOutput: Go / Clarify / No-Go.\\n\\nFR2 - Formal Strategy Validation\\nIntroduce a visible approval step (CP/MOA) before design.\\n\\nFR3 - Single Source of Truth\\nEach metric used in reports must derive from one authoritative source.\\n\\nFR4 - Automated Report Population\\nDaily/weekly CR blocks are auto-filled from Jira/Squash/Excel.\\n\\nFR5 - Standardized Anomaly Template\\nMandatory fields for clarity (context, repro, evidence, impact).\\n\\nFR6 - Evidence Traceability\\nConsistent evidence naming + links in reports and tickets.\\n\\nFR7 - Calendar-Aware Planning\\nHighlight risk against QA and HO cadence.\\n\\nFR8 - Test Asset Reuse Discovery\\nAutomatically surface relevant test cases in Squash.\\n\\nNon-Functional Requirements\\n- Must work with existing tools (Jira, Squash, Excel, PPT, Outlook, Teams, SharePoint)\\n- Must respect fixed weekly PPT slide structure\\n- Daily CR must hide empty sections\\n- Minimal change management load for stakeholders\\n\\n9) User Stories (High-Level)\\n1. As a tester, I want a testability checklist so I can decide whether a ticket is ready.\\n2. As a tester, I want formal strategy validation to avoid testing unclear scope.\\n3. As a tester, I want reports to auto-fill so I avoid manual retyping.\\n4. As a CP, I want consistent weekly reports so I can trust the data.\\n5. As a MOA, I want standardized anomaly reports for faster analysis.\\n\\n10) Constraints & Dependencies\\n- Weekly report slide structure is fixed; only hidden if irrelevant.\\n- Daily CR must exclude empty blocks.\\n- API/export access to Jira/Squash may be required.\\n- Stakeholder validation workflows must be accepted.\\n\\n11) Risks\\n- Limited API access could reduce automation potential.\\n- Change resistance to new templates or validation gates.\\n- Over-engineering might increase workload if not streamlined.\\n\\n12) Open Questions\\n- Are Jira/Squash APIs accessible, or only exports?\\n- What KPI thresholds matter most to CP/MOA?\\n- Are macros/scripts acceptable in the client environment?\\n- Who approves new templates/standards?\\n\\n13) Milestones (Suggested)\\nPhase 1 - Standardization (Quick Wins)\\n- Testability checklist + anomaly template\\n- Reporting source of truth definition\\n\\nPhase 2 - Automation\\n- Auto-fill daily CR\\n- PPT report data injection\\n\\nPhase 3 - Optimization\\n- Asset reuse discovery\\n- KPI dashboards and quality gates\\n\\n14) Requirements Prioritization\\nP0 - Must Have (critical for quality and reliability)\\n- FR1 - Testability Checklist & Score\\n- FR2 - Formal Strategy Validation\\n- FR3 - Single Source of Truth\\n- FR5 - Standardized Anomaly Template\\n- FR6 - Evidence Traceability\\n\\nP1 - Should Have (strong impact, but not blocking)\\n- FR4 - Automated Report Population\\n- FR7 - Calendar-Aware Planning\\n- FR8 - Test Asset Reuse Discovery\\n\\nP2 - Nice to Have (optimization / future)\\n- KPI dashboards beyond core KPIs\\n- Advanced automation or AI-assisted ticket analysis\\n- Cross-perimeter predictive planning\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nout = Path('/home/edouard/test-framework/_bmad-output')\\n(out / 'prd').mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\\npath = out / 'prd' / 'qa-tester-process-optimization-prd.md'\\npath.write_text(content, encoding='utf-8')\\nprint(path)\\nPY\",\"workdir\":\"/home/edouard/test-framework\"}","call_id":"call_WWdO0RQoM4mAXiU7ZczvM6pM"}}

The focus is on increasing process quality and reliability, reducing cognitive load, and improving reporting consistency, while keeping the existing toolset (Jira, Squash, Excel, PPT, Outlook, Teams, SharePoint).\\n\\n2) Why This Matters\\nCurrent workflows rely on manual data transfers between tools, variable ticket quality, and high reporting effort. These factors reduce reliability and create unnecessary risk for test outcomes and stakeholder visibility. A more standardized and traceable process improves confidence, clarity, and decision-making.\\n\\n3) Objectives\\nPrimary\\n- Improve quality and reliability of preparation and reporting processes.\\n- Standardize the way test inputs and outputs are handled.\\n\\nSecondary\\n- Reduce mental load and repetitive manual work.\\n- Improve traceability of tests, evidence, and anomalies.\\n\\n4) Scope (Phase 1)\\nIn scope\\n- Ticket readiness and testability qualification\\n- Estimation and strategy validation\\n- Standardized anomaly reporting\\n- Daily and weekly reporting consistency\\n\\nOut of scope (Phase 1)\\n- Full automation of test execution\\n- Tool replacement or migration\\n- Contractual process changes\\n\\n5) Key Challenges Observed\\n- Ticket descriptions often lack clear acceptance criteria\\n- Reporting requires manual copying and reformatting from multiple tools\\n- Anomaly descriptions are inconsistent in format and detail\\n- Reporting effort is high and varies by workload\\n\\n6) Expected Benefits\\n- More reliable test planning and execution\\n- Faster and more consistent reporting\\n- Clearer anomaly documentation for analysis and fix cycles\\n- Reduced risk of errors due to manual data transfer\\n\\n7) Proposed Direction (High-Level)\\n- Introduce a testability checklist to ensure ticket readiness\\n- Formalize validation of test strategy before design\\n- Define a single source of truth for reporting metrics\\n- Auto-populate daily and weekly reports where possible\\n- Standardize anomaly templates and evidence linking\\n\\n8) Success Indicators\\n- Higher % of tickets passing readiness checks before estimation\\n- Reduced manual data entry points per report\\n- Improved consistency of anomaly reports\\n- Lower reporting error rate and improved timeliness\\n\\n9) Open Questions\\n- Availability of API/export access for Jira and Squash\\n- Acceptance of automated or scripted reporting support\\n- Ownership for template and standard approvals\\n\\n10) Next Steps\\n- Confirm constraints and access (APIs, exports, macros)\\n- Agree on checklist, templates, and validation flow\\n- Pilot on 1–2 perimeters before wider rollout\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\nout = Path('/home/edouard/test-framework/_bmad-output')\\n(out / 'prd').mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\\npath = out / 'prd' / 'qa-tester-process-optimization-brief-client.md'\\npath.write_text(content, encoding='utf-8')\\nprint(path)\\nPY\",\"workdir\":\"/home/edouard/test-framework\"}","call_id":"call_8IlBHCt0jPDXnoOfHRQ0VSqh"}}
