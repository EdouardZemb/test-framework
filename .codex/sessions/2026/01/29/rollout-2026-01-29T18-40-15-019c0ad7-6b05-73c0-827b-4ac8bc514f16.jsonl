You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"},"git":{}}}

Mode Determination\n\n**Check if mode was specified in the command invocation:**\n\n- If user invoked with \"create prd\" or \"new prd\" or \"build prd\" or \"-c\" or \"--create\" → Set mode to **create**\n- If user invoked with \"validate prd\" or \"review prd\" or \"check prd\" or \"-v\" or \"--validate\" → Set mode to **validate**\n- If user invoked with \"edit prd\" or \"modify prd\" or \"improve prd\" or \"-e\" or \"--edit\" → Set mode to **edit**\n\n**If mode is still unclear, ask user:**\n\n\"**PRD Workflow - Select Mode:**\n\n**[C] Create** - Create a new PRD from scratch\n**[V] Validate** - Validate an existing PRD against BMAD standards\n**[E] Edit** - Improve an existing PRD\n\nWhich mode would you like?\"\n\nWait for user selection.\n\n### 2. Configuration Loading\n\nLoad and read full config from {main_config} and resolve:\n\n- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `planning_artifacts`, `user_name`\n- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`, `user_skill_level`\n- `date` as system-generated current datetime\n\n✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the configured `{communication_language}`.\n\n### 3. Route to Appropriate Workflow\n\n**IF mode == create:**\n\"**Create Mode: Creating a new PRD from scratch.**\"\nRead fully and follow: `{nextStep}` (steps-c/step-01-init.md)\n\n**IF mode == validate:**\n\"**Validate Mode: Validating an existing PRD against BMAD standards.**\"\nPrompt for PRD path: \"Which PRD would you like to validate?

Check for Existing Workflow State\n\nFirst, check if the output document already exists:\n\n**Workflow State Detection:**\n\n- Look for file at `{outputFile}`\n- If exists, read the complete file including frontmatter\n- If not exists, this is a fresh workflow\n\n### 2. Handle Continuation (If Document Exists)\n\nIf the document exists and has frontmatter with `stepsCompleted` BUT `step-11-complete` is NOT in the list, follow the Continuation Protocol since the document is incomplete:\n\n**Continuation Protocol:**\n\n- **STOP immediately** and load `{continueStepFile}`\n- Do not proceed with any initialization tasks\n- Let step-01b handle all continuation logic\n- This is an auto-proceed situation - no user choice needed\n\n### 3. Fresh Workflow Setup (If No Document)\n\nIf no document exists or no `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter:\n\n#### A. Input Document Discovery\n\nDiscover and load context documents using smart discovery. Documents can be in the following locations:\n- {planning_artifacts}/**\n- {output_folder}/**\n- {product_knowledge}/**\n- docs/**\n\nAlso - when searching - documents can be a single markdown file, or a folder with an index and multiple files. For Example, if searching for `*foo*.md` and not found, also search for a folder called *foo*/index.md (which indicates sharded content)\n\nTry to discover the following:\n- Product Brief (`*brief*.md`)\n- Research Documents (`/*research*.md`)\n- Project Documentation (generally multiple documents might be found for this in the `{product_knowledge}` or `docs` folder.)\n- Project Context (`**/project-context.md`)\n\n<critical>Confirm what you have found with the user, along with asking if the user wants to provide anything else. Only after this confirmation will you proceed to follow the loading rules</critical>\n\n**Loading Rules:**\n\n- Load ALL discovered files completely that the user confirmed or provided (no offset/limit)\n- If there is a project context, whatever is relevant should try to be biased in the remainder of this whole workflow process\n- For sharded folders, load ALL files to get complete picture, using the index first to potentially know the potential of each document\n- index.md is a guide to what's relevant whenever available\n- Track all successfully loaded files in frontmatter `inputDocuments` array\n\n#### B. Create Initial Document\n\n**Document Setup:**\n\n- Copy the template from `{prdTemplate}` to `{outputFile}`\n- Initialize frontmatter with proper structure including inputDocuments array.\n\n#### C. Present Initialization Results\n\n**Setup Report to User:**\n\n\"Welcome {{user_name}}! I've set up your PRD workspace for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Document Setup:**\n\n- Created: `{outputFile}` from template\n- Initialized frontmatter with workflow state\n\n**Input Documents Discovered:**\n\n- Product briefs: {{briefCount}} files {if briefCount > 0}✓ loaded{else}(none found){/if}\n- Research: {{researchCount}} files {if researchCount > 0}✓ loaded{else}(none found){/if}\n- Brainstorming: {{brainstormingCount}} files {if brainstormingCount > 0}✓ loaded{else}(none found){/if}\n- Project docs: {{projectDocsCount}} files {if projectDocsCount > 0}✓ loaded (brownfield project){else}(none found - greenfield project){/if}\n\n**Files loaded:** {list of specific file names or \"No additional documents found\"}\n\n{if projectDocsCount > 0}\n📋 **Note:** This is a **brownfield project**. Your existing project documentation has been loaded. In the next step, I'll ask specifically about what new features or changes you want to add to your existing system.\n{/if}\n\nDo you have any other documents you'd like me to include, or shall we continue to the next step?\"\n\n### 4. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nDisplay menu after setup report:\n\n\"[C] Continue - Save this and move to Project Discovery (Step 2 of 11)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF C: Update output file frontmatter, adding this step name to the end of the list of stepsCompleted, then read fully and follow: {nextStepFile}\n- IF user provides additional files: Load them, update inputDocuments and documentCounts, redisplay report\n- IF user asks questions: Answer and redisplay menu\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nONLY WHEN [C continue option] is selected and [frontmatter properly updated with this step added to stepsCompleted and documentCounts], will you then read fully and follow: `{nextStepFile}` to begin project discovery.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- Existing workflow detected and properly handed off to step-01b\n- Fresh workflow initialized with template and proper frontmatter\n- Input documents discovered and loaded using sharded-first logic\n- All discovered files tracked in frontmatter `inputDocuments`\n- User clearly informed of brownfield vs greenfield status\n- Menu presented and user input handled correctly\n- Frontmatter updated with this step name added to stepsCompleted before proceeding\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Proceeding with fresh initialization when existing workflow exists\n- Not updating frontmatter with discovered input documents\n- **Not storing document counts in frontmatter**\n- Creating document without proper template structure\n- Not checking sharded folders first before whole files\n- Not reporting discovered documents to user clearly\n- Proceeding without user selecting 'C' (Continue)\n\n**Master Rule:** Skipping steps, optimizing sequences, or not following exact instructions is FORBIDDEN and constitutes SYSTEM FAILURE.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The focus is on increasing process quality and reliability, reducing cognitive load, and improving reporting consistency, while keeping the existing toolset (Jira, Squash, Excel, PPT, Outlook, Teams, SharePoint).\n\n2) Why This Matters\nCurrent workflows rely on manual data transfers between tools, variable ticket quality, and high reporting effort. These factors reduce reliability and create unnecessary risk for test outcomes and stakeholder visibility. A more standardized and traceable process improves confidence, clarity, and decision-making.\n\n3) Objectives\nPrimary\n- Improve quality and reliability of preparation and reporting processes.\n- Standardize the way test inputs and outputs are handled.\n\nSecondary\n- Reduce mental load and repetitive manual work.\n- Improve traceability of tests, evidence, and anomalies.\n\n4) Scope (Phase 1)\nIn scope\n- Ticket readiness and testability qualification\n- Estimation and strategy validation\n- Standardized anomaly reporting\n- Daily and weekly reporting consistency\n\nOut of scope (Phase 1)\n- Full automation of test execution\n- Tool replacement or migration\n- Contractual process changes\n\n5) Key Challenges Observed\n- Ticket descriptions often lack clear acceptance criteria\n- Reporting requires manual copying and reformatting from multiple tools\n- Anomaly descriptions are inconsistent in format and detail\n- Reporting effort is high and varies by workload\n\n6) Expected Benefits\n- More reliable test planning and execution\n- Faster and more consistent reporting\n- Clearer anomaly documentation for analysis and fix cycles\n- Reduced risk of errors due to manual data transfer\n\n7) Proposed Direction (High-Level)\n- Introduce a testability checklist to ensure ticket readiness\n- Formalize validation of test strategy before design\n- Define a single source of truth for reporting metrics\n- Auto-populate daily and weekly reports where possible\n- Standardize anomaly templates and evidence linking\n\n8) Success Indicators\n- Higher % of tickets passing readiness checks before estimation\n- Reduced manual data entry points per report\n- Improved consistency of anomaly reports\n- Lower reporting error rate and improved timeliness\n\n9) Open Questions\n- Availability of API/export access for Jira and Squash\n- Acceptance of automated or scripted reporting support\n- Ownership for template and standard approvals\n\n10) Next Steps\n- Confirm constraints and access (APIs, exports, macros)\n- Agree on checklist, templates, and validation flow\n- Pilot on 1–2 perimeters before wider rollout\n"}}

The current process suffers from ambiguous ticket inputs, manual data transposition across tools, and inconsistent reporting standards. The target outcome is a reliable, standardized, traceable process that reduces cognitive load and improves output consistency, without changing the toolset.\n\n2) Background & Problem\nThe tester must manage multiple perimeters, perform estimation, create detailed test designs, execute tests, document evidence, and produce daily/weekly reports. Inputs (Jira tickets) often lack explicit acceptance criteria and require significant clarification. Reporting involves heavy manual extraction and re-entry into Excel and PPT, which causes errors and inconsistent outputs.\n\n3) Goals & Success Criteria\nPrimary Goals\n- Increase quality and reliability of test preparation and reporting.\n- Standardize inputs and outputs to reduce variability.\n\nSecondary Goals\n- Reduce cognitive load and manual effort.\n- Improve traceability across tests, evidence, anomalies, and reporting.\n\nSuccess Criteria (KPIs)\n- % tickets passing testability checklist before estimation\n- Reduction in manual data entry points per report\n- Template compliance rate for anomalies\n- Reporting error rate (mismatch/outdated metrics)\n- Reporting time per week (secondary KPI)\n\n4) Scope\nIn Scope (Priority)\nA) Preparation / Scoping\n- Testability qualification\n- Estimation standardization\n- Strategy validation\n- Reuse of existing test assets\n- Planning aligned with QA/HO cadence\n\nC) Reporting / CR\n- Weekly PPT reporting (fixed slide structure)\n- Daily CR reporting per perimeter\n- Final test/recipe reports + Jira comments\n\nOut of Scope (Phase 1)\n- Test execution automation\n- Tool replacement or migration\n- Contractual changes to client processes\n\n5) Users & Stakeholders\n- Primary User: QA Tester (TRA)\n- Stakeholders: CP (Project Manager), MOA, QA Lead / Pilot\n\n6) Current Workflow Summary\nPreparation / Scoping\n- Receive Jira tickets; estimate complexity and effort\n- Create estimates in Excel; align strategy with CP/MOA\n- Review Squash for reusable test cases\n- Align with QA and HO release cadence\n\nReporting\n- Weekly PPT: fixed slides with metrics, anomalies, priorities\n- Daily CR: Excel tables pasted into email\n- Recipe reports + Jira comment summarizing campaigns and evidence\n\n7) Pain Points\n- Ambiguous ticket inputs -> unreliable test design\n- Manual transposition across tools -> errors, inconsistencies\n- Lack of standardized anomaly template\n- Reporting burden -> cognitive overload\n- Environment availability disrupts flow\n\n8) Requirements\nFunctional Requirements\nFR1 - Testability Checklist & Score\nProvide a short checklist and numeric score for ticket readiness.\nOutput: Go / Clarify / No-Go.\n\nFR2 - Formal Strategy Validation\nIntroduce a visible approval step (CP/MOA) before design.\n\nFR3 - Single Source of Truth\nEach metric used in reports must derive from one authoritative source.\n\nFR4 - Automated Report Population\nDaily/weekly CR blocks are auto-filled from Jira/Squash/Excel.\n\nFR5 - Standardized Anomaly Template\nMandatory fields for clarity (context, repro, evidence, impact).\n\nFR6 - Evidence Traceability\nConsistent evidence naming + links in reports and tickets.\n\nFR7 - Calendar-Aware Planning\nHighlight risk against QA and HO cadence.\n\nFR8 - Test Asset Reuse Discovery\nAutomatically surface relevant test cases in Squash.\n\nNon-Functional Requirements\n- Must work with existing tools (Jira, Squash, Excel, PPT, Outlook, Teams, SharePoint)\n- Must respect fixed weekly PPT slide structure\n- Daily CR must hide empty sections\n- Minimal change management load for stakeholders\n\n9) User Stories (High-Level)\n1. As a tester, I want a testability checklist so I can decide whether a ticket is ready.\n2. As a tester, I want formal strategy validation to avoid testing unclear scope.\n3. As a tester, I want reports to auto-fill so I avoid manual retyping.\n4. As a CP, I want consistent weekly reports so I can trust the data.\n5. As a MOA, I want standardized anomaly reports for faster analysis.\n\n10) Constraints & Dependencies\n- Weekly report slide structure is fixed; only hidden if irrelevant.\n- Daily CR must exclude empty blocks.\n- API/export access to Jira/Squash may be required.\n- Stakeholder validation workflows must be accepted.\n\n11) Risks\n- Limited API access could reduce automation potential.\n- Change resistance to new templates or validation gates.\n- Over-engineering might increase workload if not streamlined.\n\n12) Open Questions\n- Are Jira/Squash APIs accessible, or only exports?\n- What KPI thresholds matter most to CP/MOA?\n- Are macros/scripts acceptable in the client environment?\n- Who approves new templates/standards?\n\n13) Milestones (Suggested)\nPhase 1 - Standardization (Quick Wins)\n- Testability checklist + anomaly template\n- Reporting source of truth definition\n\nPhase 2 - Automation\n- Auto-fill daily CR\n- PPT report data injection\n\nPhase 3 - Optimization\n- Asset reuse discovery\n- KPI dashboards and quality gates\n\n14) Requirements Prioritization\nP0 - Must Have (critical for quality and reliability)\n- FR1 - Testability Checklist & Score\n- FR2 - Formal Strategy Validation\n- FR3 - Single Source of Truth\n- FR5 - Standardized Anomaly Template\n- FR6 - Evidence Traceability\n\nP1 - Should Have (strong impact, but not blocking)\n- FR4 - Automated Report Population\n- FR7 - Calendar-Aware Planning\n- FR8 - Test Asset Reuse Discovery\n\nP2 - Nice to Have (optimization / future)\n- KPI dashboards beyond core KPIs\n- Advanced automation or AI-assisted ticket analysis\n- Cross-perimeter predictive planning\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(web app, API, mobile, etc.)\n- What domain does it operate in? (healthcare, fintech, e-commerce, etc.)\n- What's the project context? (greenfield new product vs brownfield existing system)\n- How complex is this domain? (low, medium, high)\n\n## DISCOVERY SEQUENCE:\n\n### 1. Check Document State\n\nRead the frontmatter from `{outputFile}` to get document counts:\n- `briefCount` - Product briefs available\n- `researchCount` - Research documents available\n- `brainstormingCount` - Brainstorming docs available\n- `projectDocsCount` - Existing project documentation\n\n**Announce your understanding:**\n\n\"From step 1, I have loaded:\n- Product briefs: {{briefCount}}\n- Research: {{researchCount}}\n- Brainstorming: {{brainstormingCount}}\n- Project docs: {{projectDocsCount}}\n\n{{if projectDocsCount > 0}}This is a brownfield project - I'll focus on understanding what you want to add or change.{{else}}This is a greenfield project - I'll help you define the full product vision.{{/if}}\"\n\n### 2. Load Classification Data\n\n**Attempt subprocess data lookup:**\n\n**Project Type Lookup:**\n\"Your task: Lookup data in {projectTypesCSV}\n\n**Search criteria:**\n- Find row where project_type matches {{detectedProjectType}}\n\n**Return format:**\nReturn ONLY the matching row as a YAML-formatted object with these fields:\nproject_type, detection_signals\n\n**Do NOT return the entire CSV - only the matching row.**\"\n\n**Domain Complexity Lookup:**\n\"Your task: Lookup data in {domainComplexityCSV}\n\n**Search criteria:**\n- Find row where domain matches {{detectedDomain}}\n\n**Return format:**\nReturn ONLY the matching row as a YAML-formatted object with these fields:\ndomain, complexity, typical_concerns, compliance_requirements\n\n**Do NOT return the entire CSV - only the matching row.**\"\n\n**Graceful degradation (if Task tool unavailable):**\n- Load the CSV files directly\n- Find the matching rows manually\n- Extract required fields\n- Keep in memory for intelligent classification\n\n### 3. Begin Discovery Conversation\n\n**Start with what you know:**\n\nIf the user has a product brief or project docs, acknowledge them and share your understanding. Then ask clarifying questions to deepen your understanding.\n\nIf this is a greenfield project with no docs, start with open-ended discovery:\n- What problem does this solve?\n- Who's it for?\n- What excites you about building this?\n\n**Listen for classification signals:**\n\nAs the user describes their product, match against:\n- **Project type signals** (API, mobile, SaaS, etc.)\n- **Domain signals** (healthcare, fintech, education, etc.)\n- **Complexity indicators** (regulated industries, novel technology, etc.)\n\n### 4. Confirm Classification\n\nOnce you have enough understanding, share your classification:\n\n\"I'm hearing this as:\n- **Project Type:** {{detectedType}}\n- **Domain:** {{detectedDomain}}\n- **Complexity:** {{complexityLevel}}\n\nDoes this sound right to you?\"\n\nLet the user confirm or refine your classification.\n\n### 5. Save Classification to Frontmatter\n\nWhen user selects 'C', update frontmatter with classification:\n```yaml\nclassification:\n  projectType: {{projectType}}\n  domain: {{domain}}\n  complexity: {{complexityLevel}}\n  projectContext: {{greenfield|brownfield}}\n```\n\n### N. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nPresent the project classification for review, then display menu:\n\n\"Based on our conversation, I've discovered and classified your project.\n\n**Here's the classification:**\n\n**Project Type:** {{detectedType}}\n**Domain:** {{detectedDomain}}\n**Complexity:** {{complexityLevel}}\n**Project Context:** {{greenfield|brownfield}}\n\n**What would you like to do?**\"\n\nDisplay: \"**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to Product Vision (Step 2b of 13)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n- IF A: Read fully and follow: {advancedElicitationTask} with the current classification, process the enhanced insights that come back, ask user if they accept the improvements, if yes update classification then redisplay menu, if no keep original classification then redisplay menu\n- IF P: Read fully and follow: {partyModeWorkflow} with the current classification, process the collaborative insights, ask user if they accept the changes, if yes update classification then redisplay menu, if no keep original classification then redisplay menu\n- IF C: Save classification to {outputFile} frontmatter, add this step name to the end of stepsCompleted array, then read fully and follow: {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other: help user respond, then redisplay menu\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution, return to this menu\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nONLY WHEN [C continue option] is selected and [classification saved to frontmatter], will you then read fully and follow: `{nextStepFile}` to explore product vision.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- Document state checked and announced to user\n- Classification data loaded and used intelligently\n- Natural conversation to understand project type, domain, complexity\n- Classification validated with user before saving\n- Frontmatter updated with classification when C selected\n- User's existing documents acknowledged and built upon\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not reading documentCounts from frontmatter first\n- Skipping classification data loading\n- Generating executive summary or vision content (that's later steps!)\n- Not validating classification with user\n- Being prescriptive instead of having natural conversation\n- Proceeding without user selecting 'C'\n\n**Master Rule:** This is classification and understanding only. No content generation yet. Build on what the user already has. Have natural conversations, don't follow scripts.\n"}}

(file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Begin Success Definition Conversation\n\n**Check Input Documents for Success Indicators:**\nAnalyze product brief, research, and brainstorming documents for success criteria already mentioned.\n\n**If Input Documents Contain Success Criteria:**\nGuide user to refine existing success criteria:\n- Acknowledge what's already documented in their materials\n- Extract key success themes from brief, research, and brainstorming\n- Help user identify gaps and areas for expansion\n- Probe for specific, measurable outcomes: When do users feel delighted/relieved/empowered?\n- Ask about emotional success moments and completion scenarios\n- Explore what \"worth it\" means beyond what's already captured\n\n**If No Success Criteria in Input Documents:**\nStart with user-centered success exploration:\n- Guide conversation toward defining what \"worth it\" means for users\n- Ask about the moment users realize their problem is solved\n- Explore specific user outcomes and emotional states\n- Identify success \"aha!\" moments and completion scenarios\n- Focus on user experience of success first\n\n### 2. Explore User Success Metrics\n\nListen for specific user outcomes and help make them measurable:\n\n- Guide from vague to specific: NOT \"users are happy\" → \"users complete [key action] within [timeframe]\"\n- Ask about emotional success: \"When do they feel delighted/relieved/empowered?\"\n- Identify success moments: \"What's the 'aha!' moment?\"\n- Define completion scenarios: \"What does 'done' look like for the user?\"\n\n### 3. Define Business Success\n\nTransition to business metrics:\n- Guide conversation to business perspective on success\n- Explore timelines: What does 3-month success look like? 12-month success?\n- Identify key business metrics: revenue, user growth, engagement, or other measures?\n- Ask what specific metric would indicate \"this is working\"\n- Understand business success from their perspective\n\n### 4. Challenge Vague Metrics\n\nPush for specificity on business metrics:\n\n- \"10,000 users\" → \"What kind of users? Doing what?\"\n- \"99.9% uptime\" → \"What's the real concern - data loss? Failed payments?\"\n- \"Fast\" → \"How fast, and what specifically needs to be fast?\"\n- \"Good adoption\" → \"What percentage adoption by when?\"\n\n### 5. Connect to Product Differentiator\n\nTie success metrics back to what makes the product special:\n- Connect success criteria to the product's unique differentiator\n- Ensure metrics reflect the specific value proposition\n- Adapt success criteria to domain context:\n  - Consumer: User love, engagement, retention\n  - B2B: ROI, efficiency, adoption\n  - Developer tools: Developer experience, community\n  - Regulated: Compliance, safety, validation\n  - GovTech: Government compliance, accessibility, procurement\n\n### 6. Smart Scope Negotiation\n\nGuide scope definition through success lens:\n- Help user distinguish MVP (must work to be useful) from growth (competitive) and vision (dream)\n- Guide conversation through three scope levels:\n  1. MVP: What's essential for proving the concept?\n  2. Growth: What makes it competitive?\n  3. Vision: What's the dream version?\n- Challenge scope creep conversationally: Could this wait until after launch? Is this essential for MVP?\n- For complex domains: Ensure compliance minimums are included in MVP\n\n### 7. Generate Success Criteria Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Success Criteria\n\n### User Success\n\n[Content about user success criteria based on conversation]\n\n### Business Success\n\n[Content about business success metrics based on conversation]\n\n### Technical Success\n\n[Content about technical success requirements based on conversation]\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n[Content about specific measurable outcomes based on conversation]\n\n## Product Scope\n\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\n\n[Content about MVP scope based on conversation]\n\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\n\n[Content about growth features based on conversation]\n\n### Vision (Future)\n\n[Content about future vision based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 8. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nPresent the success criteria content for user review, then display menu:\n\n- Show the drafted success criteria and scope definition (using structure from section 7)\n- Ask if they'd like to refine further, get other perspectives, or proceed\n- Present menu options naturally as part of the conversation\n\nDisplay: \"**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to User Journey Mapping (Step 4 of 11)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n- IF A: Read fully and follow: {advancedElicitationTask} with the current success criteria content, process the enhanced success metrics that come back, ask user \"Accept these improvements to the success criteria? (y/n)\", if yes update content with improvements then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF P: Read fully and follow: {partyModeWorkflow} with the current success criteria, process the collaborative improvements to metrics and scope, ask user \"Accept these changes to the success criteria? (y/n)\", if yes update content with improvements then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF C: Append the final content to {outputFile}, update frontmatter by adding this step name to the end of the stepsCompleted array, then read fully and follow: {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other: help user respond, then redisplay menu\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution, return to this menu\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 7.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ User success criteria clearly identified and made measurable\n✅ Business success metrics defined with specific targets\n✅ Success criteria connected to product differentiator\n✅ Scope properly negotiated (MVP, Growth, Vision)\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Accepting vague success metrics without pushing for specificity\n❌ Not connecting success criteria back to product differentiator\n❌ Missing scope negotiation and leaving it undefined\n❌ Generating content without real user input on what success looks like\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## DOMAIN CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nIf working in regulated domains (healthcare, fintech, govtech):\n\n- Include compliance milestones in success criteria\n- Add regulatory approval timelines to MVP scope\n- Consider audit requirements as technical success metrics\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-04-journeys.md` to map user journeys.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-04 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Leverage Existing Users & Identify Additional Types\n\n**Check Input Documents for Existing Personas:**\nAnalyze product brief, research, and brainstorming documents for user personas already defined.\n\n**If User Personas Exist in Input Documents:**\nGuide user to build on existing personas:\n- Acknowledge personas found in their product brief\n- Extract key persona details and backstories\n- Leverage existing insights about their needs\n- Prompt to identify additional user types beyond those documented\n- Suggest additional user types based on product context (admins, moderators, support, API consumers, internal ops)\n- Ask what additional user types should be considered\n\n**If No Personas in Input Documents:**\nStart with comprehensive user type discovery:\n- Guide exploration of ALL people who interact with the system\n- Consider beyond primary users: admins, moderators, support staff, API consumers, internal ops\n- Ask what user types should be mapped for this specific product\n- Ensure comprehensive coverage of all system interactions\n\n### 2. Create Narrative Story-Based Journeys\n\nFor each user type, create compelling narrative journeys that tell their story:\n\n#### Narrative Journey Creation Process:\n\n**If Using Existing Persona from Input Documents:**\nGuide narrative journey creation:\n- Use persona's existing backstory from brief\n- Explore how the product changes their life/situation\n- Craft journey narrative: where do we meet them, how does product help them write their next chapter?\n\n**If Creating New Persona:**\nGuide persona creation with story framework:\n- Name: realistic name and personality\n- Situation: What's happening in their life/work that creates need?\n- Goal: What do they desperately want to achieve?\n- Obstacle: What's standing in their way?\n- Solution: How does the product solve their story?\n\n**Story-Based Journey Mapping:**\n\nGuide narrative journey creation using story structure:\n- **Opening Scene**: Where/how do we meet them? What's their current pain?\n- **Rising Action**: What steps do they take? What do they discover?\n- **Climax**: Critical moment where product delivers real value\n- **Resolution**: How does their situation improve? What's their new reality?\n\nEncourage narrative format with specific user details, emotional journey, and clear before/after contrast\n\n### 3. Guide Journey Exploration\n\nFor each journey, facilitate detailed exploration:\n- What happens at each step specifically?\n- What could go wrong? What's the recovery path?\n- What information do they need to see/hear?\n- What's their emotional state at each point?\n- Where does this journey succeed or fail?\n\n### 4. Connect Journeys to Requirements\n\nAfter each journey, explicitly state:\n- This journey reveals requirements for specific capability areas\n- Help user see how different journeys create different feature sets\n- Connect journey needs to concrete capabilities (onboarding, dashboards, notifications, etc.)\n\n### 5. Aim for Comprehensive Coverage\n\nGuide toward complete journey set:\n\n- **Primary user** - happy path (core experience)\n- **Primary user** - edge case (different goal, error recovery)\n- **Secondary user** (admin, moderator, support, etc.)\n- **API consumer** (if applicable)\n\nAsk if additional journeys are needed to cover uncovered user types\n\n### 6. Generate User Journey Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## User Journeys\n\n[All journey narratives based on conversation]\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\n[Summary of capabilities revealed by journeys based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nPresent the user journey content for review, then display menu:\n- Show the mapped user journeys (using structure from section 6)\n- Highlight how each journey reveals different capabilities\n- Ask if they'd like to refine further, get other perspectives, or proceed\n- Present menu options naturally as part of conversation\n\nDisplay: \"**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to Domain Requirements (Step 5 of 11)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n- IF A: Read fully and follow: {advancedElicitationTask} with the current journey content, process the enhanced journey insights that come back, ask user \"Accept these improvements to the user journeys? (y/n)\", if yes update content with improvements then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF P: Read fully and follow: {partyModeWorkflow} with the current journeys, process the collaborative journey improvements and additions, ask user \"Accept these changes to the user journeys? (y/n)\", if yes update content with improvements then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF C: Append the final content to {outputFile}, update frontmatter by adding this step name to the end of the stepsCompleted array, then read fully and follow: {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other: help user respond, then redisplay menu\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution, return to this menu\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Existing personas from product briefs leveraged when available\n✅ All user types identified (not just primary users)\n✅ Rich narrative storytelling for each persona and journey\n✅ Complete story-based journey mapping with emotional arc\n✅ Journey requirements clearly connected to capabilities needed\n✅ Minimum 3-4 compelling narrative journeys covering different user types\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Ignoring existing personas from product briefs\n❌ Only mapping primary user journeys and missing secondary users\n❌ Creating generic journeys without rich persona details and narrative\n❌ Missing emotional storytelling elements that make journeys compelling\n❌ Missing critical decision points and failure scenarios\n❌ Not connecting journeys to required capabilities\n❌ Not having enough journey diversity (admin, support, API, etc.)\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## JOURNEY TYPES TO ENSURE:\n\n**Minimum Coverage:**\n\n1. **Primary User - Success Path**: Core experience journey\n2. **Primary User - Edge Case**: Error recovery, alternative goals\n3. **Admin/Operations User**: Management, configuration, monitoring\n4. **Support/Troubleshooting**: Help, investigation, issue resolution\n5. **API/Integration** (if applicable): Developer/technical user journey\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-05-domain.md`.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-05 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

{"timestamp":"2026-01-30T08:00:56.863Z","type":"response_item","payload":{"type":"message","role":"user","content":[{"type":"input_text","text":"Ma journée type : du ticket Jira jusqu’au reporting hebdo (avec la phase TNR)\n\nPour décrire une journée type, je prends un exemple concret : le lundi (rythme quotidien), puis j’explique la logique de lot (devis → conception → exécution), la production des reportings (quotidien + hebdo), et enfin la phase TNR en fin de lot.\n\n1) Démarrage de journée et synchronisation équipe\n9h00 – Tri des emails\n\nJe commence à 9h. J’ai souvent une quinzaine de minutes avant le weekly : je traite mes emails, je fais le tri, je supprime ce qui n’est pas pertinent, et j’épingle les messages importants (ceux qui nécessitent un suivi, qui impliquent des dépendances, ou qui concernent des sujets prioritaires).\n\n9h15 – Weekly Terra (jusqu’à 10h)\n\nÀ 9h15, j’ai le weekly de la Terra (Teams), jusqu’à 10h. C’est un point avec l’ensemble des testeurs et des pilotes :\n\nchacun explique ce qu’il a fait la semaine précédente,\n\nce qui est terminé / en cours,\n\nles informations utiles à partager,\n\net ce qui est prévu la semaine suivante.\n\nC’est aussi un point de coordination : qui intervient sur quel périmètre, à quel moment, comment on s’organise, quels sont les blocages, et si on doit planifier un point complémentaire pour débloquer une situation.\n\n2) Organisation de ma charge (cadre mensuel)\n\nAvant d’entrer dans le “faire” du jour, je dois savoir sur quel périmètre je consomme de la charge. Cette décision est anticipée :\n\nChaque début de mois, je construis un planning prévisionnel :\n\nje répartis ma charge entre les périmètres,\n\nje la place dans un calendrier,\n\nje partage le fichier aux CP concernés dans un espace partagé avec la scrum team.\n\nIls valident ou discutent les priorités, puis j’ajuste. Résultat : au quotidien, je sais sur quoi avancer, et je m’adapte en fonction de la phase du lot.\n\n3) Phase devis : du cadrage Jira à l’estimation\n\nQuand on est dans la période entre deux lots (fin du lot précédent / démarrage du suivant), je suis souvent sur la phase de devis.\n\nJe récupère le cadrage fourni par le CP et je traite les tickets un par un :\n\nje lis le ticket,\n\nj’en extrais les exigences,\n\nj’estime la conception et l’exécution associées.\n\nComme les tickets ne sont pas toujours standardisés, je m’aide souvent de ChatGPT : je lui soumets le ticket pour obtenir une extraction d’exigences et une proposition de cas de test + une stratégie de test.

À la fin, tout est prêt à être exécuté dès que les livraisons arrivent en QA.\n\n6) Phase exécution : déroulé d’une journée “terrain”\n\nEn mode exécution, mon point d’entrée principal devient Squash.\n\nAprès le weekly, je sais :\n\nsur quel périmètre je travaille,\n\nquels sujets/tickets sont prioritaires (suite au point hebdo).\n\nJe lance mon environnement (souvent via une VM), j’ouvre ma campagne Squash, je prépare l’application en QA, puis j’exécute les cas de test.\n\nPreuves de test\n\nEn parallèle, je produis mes preuves : je fais des captures vidéo, souvent une vidéo par cas de test, pour garder une traçabilité claire.\n\nEnsuite :\n\nje construis un dossier de preuves,\n\nje centralise les vidéos,\n\net je les associe aux cas de test dans un support structuré.\n\nDans mon fonctionnement actuel, je m’appuie souvent sur la génération du cahier de tests que je détourne en support de preuves : pour chaque cas listé, j’associe la vidéo correspondante.\n\nDépôt des preuves + fin de recette\n\nLe livrable de preuves, je le dépose dans SharePoint, à l’emplacement TRA dédié à l’exécution.\n\nEnsuite, je retourne sur le ticket Jira de l’évolution / du correctif et je laisse un commentaire de fin de recette :\n\nsi tout est OK : GO (avec éventuellement un rappel du périmètre testé + lien vers les preuves),\n\nsinon : je mentionne les anomalies et les points bloquants.\n\n7) Gestion des anomalies : éviter les faux positifs, créer, suivre\nAvant de créer une anomalie : enquête “environnement”\n\nQuand je constate un problème, je vérifie d’abord que ce n’est pas un faux positif lié à un environnement instable.

J’ajoute ensuite la preuve vidéo.\n\nJe l’assigne au CP du périmètre et je tague si besoin :\n\nla MOA concernée,\n\net/ou les testeurs du périmètre.\n\nLien Squash ↔ Jira\n\nEnsuite, j’associe l’anomalie à l’exécution du cas dans Squash via BugTracker : je saisis la référence Jira, Squash retrouve le ticket, et il est lié directement au cas de test dans la campagne.\n\nImpact sur l’exécution\n\nanomalie non bloquante : je continue l’exécution,\n\nanomalie bloquante : je mets l’exécution sur pause pour cette évolution, et je bascule sur d’autres tâches jusqu’au correctif.\n\n8) Fin de journée : compte-rendu quotidien (CR)\n\nEn fin de journée, je rédige mon CR quotidien sur un modèle Excel structuré par blocs. J’ai généralement Jira et Squash ouverts pour récupérer les informations.\n\nBloc conception\n\nJe renseigne ce que j’ai fait en conception :\n\nlecture SFD,\n\ncréation / mise à jour de cas de test,\n\ncréation de campagne,\n\nQuick Tests : volume prévu vs volume réalisé.\n\nBloc anomalies créées\n\nPour chaque anomalie créée :\n\ntitre,\n\nnuméro Jira,\n\nticket d’évolution associé,\n\nétat / statut.\n\nBloc anomalies traitées\n\nIci, “traitées” signifie : anomalies retestées suite à correctif livré.\nMême informations : titre, Jira, évolution liée, état / statut.\n\nBloc évolutions en cours\n\nPour les évolutions en exécution :\n\nticket d’évolution,\n\nnombre d’anomalies (bloquante / majeure / mineure),\n\n% de tests exécutés vs prévus (principalement issu de Squash).\n\nBloc réunions\n\nJe complète via Teams / Outlook :\n\nheure début / fin (durée calculée),\n\ntype (contexte ESN vs client),\n\nsujet,\n\nparticipants si utile,\n\ntotal du temps passé en réunion.\n\nJe compartimente le CR par périmètre si j’ai travaillé sur plusieurs périmètres dans la journée (les réunions peuvent être globalisées si besoin).\n\nEnsuite, je copie ces blocs dans un template d’email quotidien envoyé au pilote de la TA (et en copie aux testeurs concernés), avec une section “Points d’attention” pour remonter risques, dépendances, irritants, infos CP, etc.\n\n9) Rythme hebdo : points périmètre\n\nEn plus du weekly Terra, j’ai deux points périmètre fixes :\n\nmercredi 14h (point maintenance / point périmètre),\n\njeudi 15h (point périmètre).\n\nJe peux aussi assister à des points d’autres périmètres quand je viens en support, mais dans ce cas je ne produis pas le compte-rendu : je participe et je remonte les infos utiles.\n\n10) Préparation du reporting hebdomadaire (mercredi matin)\n\nLe mercredi matin, je prépare le reporting hebdo : un PPT standardisé commun à la TRA.\n\nJe repars du PPT de la semaine précédente :\n\nje fais une copie,\n\nje mets à jour les dates,\n\nje renseigne la météo,\n\nje mets à jour les charges consommées.\n\nSources pour les charges\n\nSi besoin, je vérifie dans le CRA (tableau Excel SharePoint rempli chaque jeudi).\nJe m’appuie aussi sur :\n\nmon prévisionnel de charge,\n\net la roadmap (Excel annuel SharePoint, alimenté par le pilote TRA) qui associe les charges aux personnes par ligne projet et par mois.\n\nJ’ai également un fichier Excel “source” (avec les tableaux du PPT) : je mets à jour les valeurs dedans puis je copie-colle dans le PPT. J’ajoute aussi les absences si nécessaire (les miennes et/ou celles du CP).\n\n11) Contenu du PPT hebdo : ce que je mets à jour\n\nRécap exécution campagne (tableau issu de Squash)\n\ncas exécutés (par suites), succès/erreurs, % exécuté\n\ncolonne % conception (utile aussi en début de lot)\n\nSuivi conception (prévisionnel vs réel)\n\nobjectif : conception terminée avant livraison QA\n\nprévisionnel vs réel + effort restant si retard\n\nSuivi exécution (prévisionnel vs réel)\n\nprévisionnel vs réel + effort de rattrapage\n\nAnomalies en cours\n\nliste via filtre Jira / capture : anomalies non clôturées (à analyser, en cours, en réalisation, etc.)\n\nPriorités\n\nje déplace les “priorités à venir” de la semaine dernière en “priorités de la semaine précédente”\n\nles nouvelles priorités sont définies en séance\n\nAnomalies abandonnées (slide conditionnelle)\n\naffichée uniquement s’il y en a\n\ndiscussion sur le motif, et vigilance si quelqu’un abandonne “à ma place”\n\nWidget Jira – récap anomalies du lot (TRA + MOA)\n\ntableau croisant statuts et criticité (bloquante/majeure/mineure)\n\ndiscussion pilotage : anticipation charge, volume de correctifs, risque de passage direct en homologation, etc.\n\nDette de conception (rétroconception)\n\nquand on priorise l’exécution au détriment de la conception\n\nsuivi des sujets à rattraper + charge associée + avancement\n\n12) Fin de lot : phase TNR (tests de non-régression)\n\nUne phase importante que je n’avais pas mentionnée au début, c’est la phase TNR, qui arrive généralement sur les dernières itérations du lot (souvent itération 4 ou 5, parfois une 6ᵉ).\n\nObjectif et périmètre\n\nLe TNR repose sur une campagne de référence, élaborée avec la MOA, qui définit ce qui doit absolument fonctionner pour pouvoir donner un GO production.\n\nIl y a :\n\nune campagne manuelle (celle que j’exécute),\n\net une partie automatisée.\n\nLa partie automatisée n’est pas pilotée par la TRA “au quotidien” : elle est gérée par un testeur automatisation interne. On essaie de se coordonner, mais ils ont leur propre reporting. De mon côté, je fais uniquement le manuel, avec l’idée que certains tests pourront être automatisés à terme (sans que ce soit systématiquement garanti).\n\nMise en place de la campagne TNR\n\nOn a dans Squash un espace dédié au TNR de référence (conception + exécution). À chaque nouveau lot :\n\nje copie la campagne (ou la structure d’exécution) vers l’espace TNR du nouveau lot,\n\net je m’aligne sur le planning de TNR.\n\nLe planning est défini par le pilote, en collaboration avec les CP des différents périmètres, via un tableau sur SharePoint qui fixe les jours d’exécution TNR.\n\nLes TNR se déroulent sur l’environnement d’homologation.\n\nGestion des anomalies en TNR\n\nSi je détecte des anomalies pendant les TNR, je les crée dans Jira comme d’habitude, mais je les tague avec un libellé spécifique au lot (par exemple du type : TNR / TRA / Lot XXX selon le numéro de release). Ça permet de filtrer facilement ce qui relève des TNR.\n\nReporting TNR (GO / NO-GO)\n\nÀ la fin, je fais un reporting TNR sur un modèle standardisé : un petit PowerPoint très simple (en général 2 slides) avec un avis :\n\nGO\n\nNO-GO\n\nou GO avec réserves\n\nSi je mets “GO avec réserves”, je détaille les réserves : généralement je liste les anomalies associées avec un lien vers les tickets Jira.\n\nJ’ajoute aussi des captures Squash :\n\nl’avancement de la campagne (par suites de tests),\n\net un graphique de synthèse (camembert : taux de succès / échec / etc.).\n\nLa dernière slide contient un tableau récapitulatif des anomalies déclarées pendant les TNR, et une zone “commentaires” si j’ai des points à remonter en dehors des réserves.\n\nUne fois le PPT terminé, je l’envoie par mail au CPI, avec le pilote en copie.\n\nDe mon point de vue, l’automatisation fait vraiment sens à partir du moment où je dois recouper et consolider des informations issues de Squash et de Jira. Comme j’ai accès aux API, tout ce qui relève de la récupération de données (statuts, volumes, pourcentages d’avancement, anomalies, liens entre tickets, etc.) pourrait être automatisé assez facilement pour alimenter directement les différents comptes-rendus et en générer une grande partie automatiquement. En clair : tout ce qui ne demande pas d’analyse ou de décision humaine, mais simplement de la collecte et de la mise en forme, est un bon candidat.\n\nL’autre aspect, c’est mon usage de ChatGPT. Aujourd’hui, je trouve que c’est une perte de temps de passer par l’interface : ouvrir le chat, copier-coller le ticket Jira, recopier des éléments, reformuler, puis revenir dans Jira ou Squash. J’aimerais intégrer ça dans un workflow maîtrisé, que je peux faire évoluer progressivement, mais de façon programmatique. L’objectif serait que ce workflow puisse :\n\ngénérer directement des livrables (ou au minimum des brouillons),\n\nque je n’aie plus qu’à relire et ajuster,\n\npuis publier rapidement dans Jira ou Squash.\n\nJe pense notamment à la conception : au lieu de faire des allers-retours manuels, je préférerais avoir une chaîne de traitement qui transforme un ticket (ou un cadrage) en proposition structurée de cas de test, prête à être retravaillée et injectée dans l’outil.\n\nEnfin, il y a un sujet plus ambitieux que j’aimerais explorer : exploiter les vidéos de preuves de test. Je vois ça comme un projet plus conséquent, mais potentiellement très puissant. L’idée serait qu’à partir des vidéos capturées pendant l’exécution, une partie du workflow se déclenche automatiquement pour :\n\ncomparer l’exécution réelle (ce qu’on voit dans la vidéo) avec le cas de test décrit dans Squash,\n\nidentifier un delta (écarts, imprécisions, étapes manquantes, formulation ambiguë),\n\net, via l’intelligence artificielle, proposer des suggestions d’amélioration pour mieux rédiger et maintenir les cas de test.\n\nAu final, ça permettrait à la fois de gagner du temps sur la production des livrables, et d’améliorer la qualité et la fiabilité des cas de test au fil des exécutions.\n\nJe vais maintenant décrire la version “edge case” d’une journée : celle où tout s’enchaîne mal et où je perds rapidement la maîtrise du temps et de la structure.\n\nSi je reprends l’exemple du lundi, le premier problème possible, c’est un weekly qui déborde. Ça peut durer dix minutes… mais parfois ça monte à une demi-heure. Là-dessus, je n’ai pas vraiment la main : ça dépend essentiellement du pilote et de la dynamique du point.\n\nEnsuite, si je suis en phase devis, le pire scénario, c’est un cadrage très volumineux, avec beaucoup de tickets Jira à traiter. Dans ce cas, je peux rapidement me retrouver à faire des estimations “à droite à gauche”, à m’éparpiller, et à perdre la structure : je passe d’un ticket à l’autre, je me perds dans ChatGPT, je tente des chiffrages sans fil conducteur. Résultat : je perds énormément de temps et je n’avance pas de manière efficace.\n\nLe problème est encore amplifié quand, en plus, les tickets sont mal rédigés ou incomplets. Je dois alors aller chercher l’information : poser des questions à la MOA, relancer sur Teams ou dans Jira, recroiser des éléments. Et dans ce contexte, je peux aussi tomber dans un autre piège : consacrer trop de temps à la conception ou à l’analyse “pour compenser” le manque de cadrage, alors que je n’ai ni le temps ni la structure pour le faire correctement.\n\nCe que j’aimerais, dans cette phase, c’est que l’outillage m’aide à restructurer mon travail : un processus plus industrialisé, avec des étapes claires, des “garde-fous”, et des actions définies quand je rencontre un blocage. L’objectif, c’est de réduire ma charge mentale et d’éviter de rentrer dans une boucle où je tourne en rond et où je me perds.\n\nUn autre risque dans ce type de journée, c’est la dérive de charge : je peux me rendre compte trop tard que je suis en train de consommer beaucoup plus que ce qui est alloué. Et là, le pire scénario, c’est d’essayer de rattraper sur du temps personnel, ou de devoir “bricoler” pour faire rentrer la réalité dans le cadre prévu. C’est clairement une situation que je veux éviter.\n\nEn phase d’exécution, le scénario “catastrophe” est différent : je peux me retrouver avec des cas de test conçus trop vite, pas assez propres, pas assez maintenables. Le pire, c’est quand je les exécute sans prendre le temps (ou sans avoir le réflexe) de les corriger et les améliorer au passage. Dans ce cas, le référentiel ne s’améliore pas : la qualité reste moyenne, et on traîne cette dette de qualité d’un lot à l’autre. Là aussi, je suis convaincu qu’avec un processus plus structuré et plus industrialisé, je pourrais viser des objectifs plus ambitieux sur la qualité du référentiel.\n\nUn autre point critique, c’est le compte-rendu quotidien : quand j’ai débordé de partout, je peux finir par ne pas l’envoyer, parce que je me dis que je n’ai pas “encore” les 20–30 minutes nécessaires pour le faire correctement. Et ça, c’est justement l’un des arguments les plus forts en faveur de l’automatisation : si le CR est largement pré-rempli automatiquement, je n’ai plus qu’à relire, compléter, et l’envoyer. Ça sécurise le “rituel” quotidien, même dans une journée difficile.\n\nLe reporting hebdomadaire, c’est un peu la même logique : quand je le fais en dernière minute, je suis en stress, je récupère les informations à la volée, je cours après les chiffres et les captures. Là encore, l’automatisation des extractions (Jira / Squash / charges) et la pré-génération du support réduiraient énormément la pression.\n\nEnfin, sur les TNR, il y a un vrai sujet de fond : la qualité des cas de test TNR est souvent insuffisante. Et comme c’est une campagne critique pour le GO production, c’est problématique. C’est là que l’idée d’un projet “deep” autour de l’IA prend tout son sens : utiliser les preuves d’exécution (vidéos) et le référentiel Squash pour détecter des écarts et proposer des améliorations de rédaction. C’est ambitieux, mais ça répond à un besoin réel : améliorer durablement la qualité des TNR et éviter de rejouer, lot après lot, des cas de test mal écrits.\n\nEn résumé, dans les pires scénarios, tout déborde : je perds la structure, je consomme de la charge que je n’ai pas, je prends du retard sur les rituels (CR quotidien / hebdo), et je finis soit par rattraper sur du temps personnel, soit par “compenser” de manière imparfaite. Et c’est précisément là que je pense que l’automatisation et l’industrialisation du workflow auraient le plus d’impact."}]}}

J’ai souvent une quinzaine de minutes avant le weekly : je traite mes emails, je fais le tri, je supprime ce qui n’est pas pertinent, et j’épingle les messages importants (ceux qui nécessitent un suivi, qui impliquent des dépendances, ou qui concernent des sujets prioritaires).\n\n9h15 – Weekly Terra (jusqu’à 10h)\n\nÀ 9h15, j’ai le weekly de la Terra (Teams), jusqu’à 10h. C’est un point avec l’ensemble des testeurs et des pilotes :\n\nchacun explique ce qu’il a fait la semaine précédente,\n\nce qui est terminé / en cours,\n\nles informations utiles à partager,\n\net ce qui est prévu la semaine suivante.\n\nC’est aussi un point de coordination : qui intervient sur quel périmètre, à quel moment, comment on s’organise, quels sont les blocages, et si on doit planifier un point complémentaire pour débloquer une situation.\n\n2) Organisation de ma charge (cadre mensuel)\n\nAvant d’entrer dans le “faire” du jour, je dois savoir sur quel périmètre je consomme de la charge. Cette décision est anticipée :\n\nChaque début de mois, je construis un planning prévisionnel :\n\nje répartis ma charge entre les périmètres,\n\nje la place dans un calendrier,\n\nje partage le fichier aux CP concernés dans un espace partagé avec la scrum team.\n\nIls valident ou discutent les priorités, puis j’ajuste. Résultat : au quotidien, je sais sur quoi avancer, et je m’adapte en fonction de la phase du lot.\n\n3) Phase devis : du cadrage Jira à l’estimation\n\nQuand on est dans la période entre deux lots (fin du lot précédent / démarrage du suivant), je suis souvent sur la phase de devis.\n\nJe récupère le cadrage fourni par le CP et je traite les tickets un par un :\n\nje lis le ticket,\n\nj’en extrais les exigences,\n\nj’estime la conception et l’exécution associées.\n\nComme les tickets ne sont pas toujours standardisés, je m’aide souvent de ChatGPT : je lui soumets le ticket pour obtenir une extraction d’exigences et une proposition de cas de test + une stratégie de test.

Ça permet de filtrer facilement ce qui relève des TNR.\n\nReporting TNR (GO / NO-GO)\n\nÀ la fin, je fais un reporting TNR sur un modèle standardisé : un petit PowerPoint très simple (en général 2 slides) avec un avis :\n\nGO\n\nNO-GO\n\nou GO avec réserves\n\nSi je mets “GO avec réserves”, je détaille les réserves : généralement je liste les anomalies associées avec un lien vers les tickets Jira.\n\nJ’ajoute aussi des captures Squash :\n\nl’avancement de la campagne (par suites de tests),\n\net un graphique de synthèse (camembert : taux de succès / échec / etc.).\n\nLa dernière slide contient un tableau récapitulatif des anomalies déclarées pendant les TNR, et une zone “commentaires” si j’ai des points à remonter en dehors des réserves.\n\nUne fois le PPT terminé, je l’envoie par mail au CPI, avec le pilote en copie.\n\nDe mon point de vue, l’automatisation fait vraiment sens à partir du moment où je dois recouper et consolider des informations issues de Squash et de Jira. Comme j’ai accès aux API, tout ce qui relève de la récupération de données (statuts, volumes, pourcentages d’avancement, anomalies, liens entre tickets, etc.) pourrait être automatisé assez facilement pour alimenter directement les différents comptes-rendus et en générer une grande partie automatiquement. En clair : tout ce qui ne demande pas d’analyse ou de décision humaine, mais simplement de la collecte et de la mise en forme, est un bon candidat.\n\nL’autre aspect, c’est mon usage de ChatGPT. Aujourd’hui, je trouve que c’est une perte de temps de passer par l’interface : ouvrir le chat, copier-coller le ticket Jira, recopier des éléments, reformuler, puis revenir dans Jira ou Squash. J’aimerais intégrer ça dans un workflow maîtrisé, que je peux faire évoluer progressivement, mais de façon programmatique. L’objectif serait que ce workflow puisse :\n\ngénérer directement des livrables (ou au minimum des brouillons),\n\nque je n’aie plus qu’à relire et ajuster,\n\npuis publier rapidement dans Jira ou Squash.\n\nJe pense notamment à la conception : au lieu de faire des allers-retours manuels, je préférerais avoir une chaîne de traitement qui transforme un ticket (ou un cadrage) en proposition structurée de cas de test, prête à être retravaillée et injectée dans l’outil.\n\nEnfin, il y a un sujet plus ambitieux que j’aimerais explorer : exploiter les vidéos de preuves de test. Je vois ça comme un projet plus conséquent, mais potentiellement très puissant. L’idée serait qu’à partir des vidéos capturées pendant l’exécution, une partie du workflow se déclenche automatiquement pour :\n\ncomparer l’exécution réelle (ce qu’on voit dans la vidéo) avec le cas de test décrit dans Squash,\n\nidentifier un delta (écarts, imprécisions, étapes manquantes, formulation ambiguë),\n\net, via l’intelligence artificielle, proposer des suggestions d’amélioration pour mieux rédiger et maintenir les cas de test.\n\nAu final, ça permettrait à la fois de gagner du temps sur la production des livrables, et d’améliorer la qualité et la fiabilité des cas de test au fil des exécutions.\n\nJe vais maintenant décrire la version “edge case” d’une journée : celle où tout s’enchaîne mal et où je perds rapidement la maîtrise du temps et de la structure.\n\nSi je reprends l’exemple du lundi, le premier problème possible, c’est un weekly qui déborde. Ça peut durer dix minutes… mais parfois ça monte à une demi-heure. Là-dessus, je n’ai pas vraiment la main : ça dépend essentiellement du pilote et de la dynamique du point.\n\nEnsuite, si je suis en phase devis, le pire scénario, c’est un cadrage très volumineux, avec beaucoup de tickets Jira à traiter. Dans ce cas, je peux rapidement me retrouver à faire des estimations “à droite à gauche”, à m’éparpiller, et à perdre la structure : je passe d’un ticket à l’autre, je me perds dans ChatGPT, je tente des chiffrages sans fil conducteur. Résultat : je perds énormément de temps et je n’avance pas de manière efficace.\n\nLe problème est encore amplifié quand, en plus, les tickets sont mal rédigés ou incomplets. Je dois alors aller chercher l’information : poser des questions à la MOA, relancer sur Teams ou dans Jira, recroiser des éléments. Et dans ce contexte, je peux aussi tomber dans un autre piège : consacrer trop de temps à la conception ou à l’analyse “pour compenser” le manque de cadrage, alors que je n’ai ni le temps ni la structure pour le faire correctement.\n\nCe que j’aimerais, dans cette phase, c’est que l’outillage m’aide à restructurer mon travail : un processus plus industrialisé, avec des étapes claires, des “garde-fous”, et des actions définies quand je rencontre un blocage. L’objectif, c’est de réduire ma charge mentale et d’éviter de rentrer dans une boucle où je tourne en rond et où je me perds.\n\nUn autre risque dans ce type de journée, c’est la dérive de charge : je peux me rendre compte trop tard que je suis en train de consommer beaucoup plus que ce qui est alloué. Et là, le pire scénario, c’est d’essayer de rattraper sur du temps personnel, ou de devoir “bricoler” pour faire rentrer la réalité dans le cadre prévu. C’est clairement une situation que je veux éviter.\n\nEn phase d’exécution, le scénario “catastrophe” est différent : je peux me retrouver avec des cas de test conçus trop vite, pas assez propres, pas assez maintenables. Le pire, c’est quand je les exécute sans prendre le temps (ou sans avoir le réflexe) de les corriger et les améliorer au passage. Dans ce cas, le référentiel ne s’améliore pas : la qualité reste moyenne, et on traîne cette dette de qualité d’un lot à l’autre. Là aussi, je suis convaincu qu’avec un processus plus structuré et plus industrialisé, je pourrais viser des objectifs plus ambitieux sur la qualité du référentiel.\n\nUn autre point critique, c’est le compte-rendu quotidien : quand j’ai débordé de partout, je peux finir par ne pas l’envoyer, parce que je me dis que je n’ai pas “encore” les 20–30 minutes nécessaires pour le faire correctement. Et ça, c’est justement l’un des arguments les plus forts en faveur de l’automatisation : si le CR est largement pré-rempli automatiquement, je n’ai plus qu’à relire, compléter, et l’envoyer. Ça sécurise le “rituel” quotidien, même dans une journée difficile.\n\nLe reporting hebdomadaire, c’est un peu la même logique : quand je le fais en dernière minute, je suis en stress, je récupère les informations à la volée, je cours après les chiffres et les captures. Là encore, l’automatisation des extractions (Jira / Squash / charges) et la pré-génération du support réduiraient énormément la pression.\n\nEnfin, sur les TNR, il y a un vrai sujet de fond : la qualité des cas de test TNR est souvent insuffisante. Et comme c’est une campagne critique pour le GO production, c’est problématique. C’est là que l’idée d’un projet “deep” autour de l’IA prend tout son sens : utiliser les preuves d’exécution (vidéos) et le référentiel Squash pour détecter des écarts et proposer des améliorations de rédaction. C’est ambitieux, mais ça répond à un besoin réel : améliorer durablement la qualité des TNR et éviter de rejouer, lot après lot, des cas de test mal écrits.\n\nEn résumé, dans les pires scénarios, tout déborde : je perds la structure, je consomme de la charge que je n’ai pas, je prends du retard sur les rituels (CR quotidien / hebdo), et je finis soit par rattraper sur du temps personnel, soit par “compenser” de manière imparfaite. Et c’est précisément là que je pense que l’automatisation et l’industrialisation du workflow auraient le plus d’impact.","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

Check Domain Complexity\n\n**Review classification from step-02:**\n\n- What's the domain complexity level? (low/medium/high)\n- What's the specific domain? (healthcare, fintech, education, etc.)\n\n**If complexity is LOW:**\n\nOffer to skip:\n\"The domain complexity from our discovery is low. We may not need deep domain-specific requirements. Would you like to:\n- [C] Skip this step and move to Innovation\n- [D] Do domain exploration anyway\"\n\n**If complexity is MEDIUM or HIGH:**\n\nProceed with domain exploration.\n\n### 2. Load Domain Reference Data\n\n**Attempt subprocess data lookup:**\n\n\"Your task: Lookup data in {domainComplexityCSV}\n\n**Search criteria:**\n- Find row where domain matches {{domainFromStep02}}\n\n**Return format:**\nReturn ONLY the matching row as a YAML-formatted object with these fields:\ndomain, complexity, typical_concerns, compliance_requirements\n\n**Do NOT return the entire CSV - only the matching row.**\"\n\n**Graceful degradation (if Task tool unavailable):**\n- Load the CSV file directly\n- Find the matching row manually\n- Extract required fields\n- Understand typical concerns and compliance requirements\n\n### 3. Explore Domain-Specific Concerns\n\n**Start with what you know:**\n\nAcknowledge the domain and explore what makes it complex:\n- What regulations apply? (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, SOX, etc.)\n- What standards matter? (ISO, NIST, domain-specific standards)\n- What certifications are needed? (security, privacy, domain-specific)\n- What integrations are required? (EMR systems, payment processors, etc.)\n\n**Explore technical constraints:**\n- Security requirements (encryption, audit logs, access control)\n- Privacy requirements (data handling, consent, retention)\n- Performance requirements (real-time, batch, latency)\n- Availability requirements (uptime, disaster recovery)\n\n### 4. Document Domain Requirements\n\n**Structure the requirements around key concerns:**\n\n```markdown\n### Compliance & Regulatory\n- [Specific requirements]\n\n### Technical Constraints\n- [Security, privacy, performance needs]\n\n### Integration Requirements\n- [Required systems and data flows]\n\n### Risk Mitigations\n- [Domain-specific risks and how to address them]\n```\n\n### 5. Validate Completeness\n\n**Check with the user:**\n\n\"Are there other domain-specific concerns we should consider? For [this domain], what typically gets overlooked?\"\n\n### N. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nDisplay: \"**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue - Save and Proceed to Innovation (Step 6 of 13)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n- IF A: Read fully and follow: {advancedElicitationTask}, and when finished redisplay the menu\n- IF P: Read fully and follow: {partyModeWorkflow}, and when finished redisplay the menu\n- IF C: Save content to {outputFile}, update frontmatter, then read fully and follow: {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then [Redisplay Menu Options](#n-present-menu-options)\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution, return to this menu\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append to `{outputFile}`:\n\n```markdown\n## Domain-Specific Requirements\n\n{{discovered domain requirements}}\n```\n\nIf step was skipped, append nothing and proceed.\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nONLY WHEN [C continue option] is selected and [content saved or skipped], will you then read fully and follow: `{nextStepFile}` to explore innovation.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- Domain complexity checked before proceeding\n- Offered to skip if complexity is low\n- Natural conversation exploring domain concerns\n- Compliance, technical, and integration requirements identified\n- Domain-specific risks documented with mitigations\n- User validated completeness\n- Content properly saved (or step skipped) when C selected\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not checking domain complexity first\n- Not offering to skip for low-complexity domains\n- Missing critical compliance requirements\n- Not exploring technical constraints\n- Not asking about domain-specific risks\n- Being generic instead of domain-specific\n- Proceeding without user validation\n\n**Master Rule:** This step is OPTIONAL for simple domains. For complex domains, focus on compliance, constraints, and domain patterns. Natural conversation, not checklists.\n"}}

Load Project-Type Innovation Data\n\nLoad innovation signals specific to this project type:\n\n- Load `{projectTypesCSV}` completely\n- Find the row where `project_type` matches detected type from step-02\n- Extract `innovation_signals` (semicolon-separated list)\n- Extract `web_search_triggers` for potential innovation research\n\n### 2. Listen for Innovation Indicators\n\nMonitor conversation for both general and project-type-specific innovation signals:\n\n#### General Innovation Language:\n\n- \"Nothing like this exists\"\n- \"We're rethinking how [X] works\"\n- \"Combining [A] with [B] for the first time\"\n- \"Novel approach to [problem]\"\n- \"No one has done [concept] before\"\n\n#### Project-Type-Specific Signals (from CSV):\n\nMatch user descriptions against innovation_signals for their project_type:\n\n- **api_backend**: \"API composition;New protocol\"\n- **mobile_app**: \"Gesture innovation;AR/VR features\"\n- **saas_b2b**: \"Workflow automation;AI agents\"\n- **developer_tool**: \"New paradigm;DSL creation\"\n\n### 3. Initial Innovation Screening\n\nAsk targeted innovation discovery questions:\n- Guide exploration of what makes the product innovative\n- Explore if they're challenging existing assumptions\n- Ask about novel combinations of technologies/approaches\n- Identify what hasn't been done before\n- Understand which aspects feel most innovative\n\n### 4. Deep Innovation Exploration (If Detected)\n\nIf innovation signals are found, explore deeply:\n\n#### Innovation Discovery Questions:\n- What makes it unique compared to existing solutions?\n- What assumption are you challenging?\n- How do we validate it works?\n- What's the fallback if it doesn't?\n- Has anyone tried this before?\n\n#### Market Context Research:\n\nIf relevant innovation detected, consider web search for context:\nUse `web_search_triggers` from project-type CSV:\n`[web_search_triggers] {concept} innovations {date}`\n\n### 5. Generate Innovation Content (If Innovation Detected)\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Innovation & Novel Patterns\n\n### Detected Innovation Areas\n\n[Innovation patterns identified based on conversation]\n\n### Market Context & Competitive Landscape\n\n[Market context and research based on conversation]\n\n### Validation Approach\n\n[Validation methodology based on conversation]\n\n### Risk Mitigation\n\n[Innovation risks and fallbacks based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS (Only if Innovation Detected)\n\nPresent the innovation content for review, then display menu:\n- Show identified innovative aspects (using structure from section 5)\n- Highlight differentiation from existing solutions\n- Ask if they'd like to refine further, get other perspectives, or proceed\n- Present menu options naturally as part of conversation\n\nDisplay: \"**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to Project Type Analysis (Step 7 of 11)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n- IF A: Read fully and follow: {advancedElicitationTask} with the current innovation content, process the enhanced innovation insights that come back, ask user \"Accept these improvements to the innovation analysis? (y/n)\", if yes update content with improvements then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF P: Read fully and follow: {partyModeWorkflow} with the current innovation content, process the collaborative innovation exploration and ideation, ask user \"Accept these changes to the innovation analysis? (y/n)\", if yes update content with improvements then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF C: Append the final content to {outputFile}, update frontmatter by adding this step name to the end of the stepsCompleted array, then read fully and follow: {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other: help user respond, then redisplay menu\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution, return to this menu\n\n## NO INNOVATION DETECTED:\n\nIf no genuine innovation signals are found after exploration:\n- Acknowledge that no clear innovation signals were found\n- Note this is fine - many successful products are excellent executions of existing concepts\n- Ask if they'd like to try finding innovative angles or proceed\n\nDisplay: \"**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's try to find innovative angles [C] Continue - Skip innovation section and move to Project Type Analysis (Step 7 of 11)\"\n\n### Menu Handling Logic:\n- IF A: Proceed with content generation anyway, then return to menu\n- IF C: Skip this step, then read fully and follow: {nextStepFile}\n\n### EXECUTION RULES:\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 5.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Innovation signals properly detected from user conversation\n✅ Project-type innovation signals used to guide discovery\n✅ Genuine innovation explored (not forced creativity)\n✅ Validation approach clearly defined for innovative aspects\n✅ Risk mitigation strategies identified\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Forced innovation when none genuinely exists\n❌ Not using project-type innovation signals from CSV\n❌ Missing market context research for novel concepts\n❌ Not addressing validation approach for innovative features\n❌ Creating innovation theater without real innovative aspects\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## SKIP CONDITIONS:\n\nSkip this step and load `{nextStepFile}` if:\n\n- No innovation signals detected in conversation\n- Product is incremental improvement rather than breakthrough\n- User confirms innovation exploration is not needed\n- Project-type CSV has no innovation signals for this type\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document (or step is skipped), load `{nextStepFile}`.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-07 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu (or confirms step skip)!\n"}}

Load Project-Type Configuration Data\n\n**Attempt subprocess data lookup:**\n\n\"Your task: Lookup data in {projectTypesCSV}\n\n**Search criteria:**\n- Find row where project_type matches {{projectTypeFromStep02}}\n\n**Return format:**\nReturn ONLY the matching row as a YAML-formatted object with these fields:\nproject_type, key_questions, required_sections, skip_sections, innovation_signals\n\n**Do NOT return the entire CSV - only the matching row.**\"\n\n**Graceful degradation (if Task tool unavailable):**\n- Load the CSV file directly\n- Find the matching row manually\n- Extract required fields:\n  - `key_questions` (semicolon-separated list of discovery questions)\n  - `required_sections` (semicolon-separated list of sections to document)\n  - `skip_sections` (semicolon-separated list of sections to skip)\n  - `innovation_signals` (already explored in step-6)\n\n### 2. Conduct Guided Discovery Using Key Questions\n\nParse `key_questions` from CSV and explore each:\n\n#### Question-Based Discovery:\n\nFor each question in `key_questions` from CSV:\n\n- Ask the user naturally in conversational style\n- Listen for their response and ask clarifying follow-ups\n- Connect answers to product value proposition\n\n**Example Flow:**\nIf key_questions = \"Endpoints needed?;Authentication method?;Data formats?;Rate limits?;Versioning?;SDK needed?\"\n\nAsk naturally:\n\n- \"What are the main endpoints your API needs to expose?\"\n- \"How will you handle authentication and authorization?\"\n- \"What data formats will you support for requests and responses?\"\n\n### 3. Document Project-Type Specific Requirements\n\nBased on user answers to key_questions, synthesize comprehensive requirements:\n\n#### Requirement Categories:\n\nCover the areas indicated by `required_sections` from CSV:\n\n- Synthesize what was discovered for each required section\n- Document specific requirements, constraints, and decisions\n- Connect to product differentiator when relevant\n\n#### Skip Irrelevant Sections:\n\nSkip areas indicated by `skip_sections` from CSV to avoid wasting time on irrelevant aspects.\n\n### 4. Generate Dynamic Content Sections\n\nParse `required_sections` list from the matched CSV row. For each section name, generate corresponding content:\n\n#### Common CSV Section Mappings:\n\n- \"endpoint_specs\" or \"endpoint_specification\" → API endpoints documentation\n- \"auth_model\" or \"authentication_model\" → Authentication approach\n- \"platform_reqs\" or \"platform_requirements\" → Platform support needs\n- \"device_permissions\" or \"device_features\" → Device capabilities\n- \"tenant_model\" → Multi-tenancy approach\n- \"rbac_matrix\" or \"permission_matrix\" → Permission structure\n\n#### Template Variable Strategy:\n\n- For sections matching common template variables: generate specific content\n- For sections without template matches: include in main project_type_requirements\n- Hybrid approach balances template structure with CSV-driven flexibility\n\n### 5. Generate Project-Type Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## [Project Type] Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n\n[Project type summary based on conversation]\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n\n[Technical architecture requirements based on conversation]\n\n[Dynamic sections based on CSV and conversation]\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n[Implementation specific requirements based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nPresent the project-type content for review, then display menu:\n\n\"Based on our conversation and best practices for this product type, I've documented the {project_type}-specific requirements for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from section 5]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\"\n\nDisplay: \"**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to Scoping (Step 8 of 11)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n- IF A: Read fully and follow: {advancedElicitationTask} with the current project-type content, process the enhanced technical insights that come back, ask user \"Accept these improvements to the technical requirements? (y/n)\", if yes update content with improvements then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF P: Read fully and follow: {partyModeWorkflow} with the current project-type requirements, process the collaborative technical expertise and validation, ask user \"Accept these changes to the technical requirements? (y/n)\", if yes update content with improvements then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF C: Append the final content to {outputFile}, update frontmatter by adding this step name to the end of the stepsCompleted array, then read fully and follow: {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other: help user respond, then redisplay menu\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution, return to this menu\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from previous steps.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Project-type configuration loaded and used effectively\n✅ All key questions from CSV explored with user input\n✅ Required sections generated per CSV configuration\n✅ Skip sections properly avoided to save time\n✅ Technical requirements connected to product value\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not loading or using project-type CSV configuration\n❌ Missing key questions from CSV in discovery process\n❌ Not generating required sections per CSV configuration\n❌ Documenting sections that should be skipped per CSV\n❌ Creating generic content without project-type specificity\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## PROJECT-TYPE EXAMPLES:\n\n**For api_backend:**\n\n- Focus on endpoints, authentication, data schemas, rate limiting\n- Skip visual design and user journey sections\n- Generate API specification documentation\n\n**For mobile_app:**\n\n- Focus on platform requirements, device permissions, offline mode\n- Skip API endpoint documentation unless needed\n- Generate mobile-specific technical requirements\n\n**For saas_b2b:**\n\n- Focus on multi-tenancy, permissions, integrations\n- Skip mobile-first considerations unless relevant\n- Generate enterprise-specific requirements\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `{nextStepFile}` to define project scope.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-08 (Scoping) until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Review Current PRD State\n\nAnalyze everything documented so far:\n- Present synthesis of established vision, success criteria, journeys\n- Assess domain and innovation focus\n- Evaluate scope implications: simple MVP, medium, or complex project\n- Ask if initial assessment feels right or if they see it differently\n\n### 2. Define MVP Strategy\n\nFacilitate strategic MVP decisions:\n- Explore MVP philosophy options: problem-solving, experience, platform, or revenue MVP\n- Ask critical questions:\n  - What's the minimum that would make users say 'this is useful'?\n  - What would make investors/partners say 'this has potential'?\n  - What's the fastest path to validated learning?\n- Guide toward appropriate MVP approach for their product\n\n### 3. Scoping Decision Framework\n\nUse structured decision-making for scope:\n\n**Must-Have Analysis:**\n- Guide identification of absolute MVP necessities\n- For each journey and success criterion, ask:\n  - Without this, does the product fail?\n  - Can this be manual initially?\n  - Is this a deal-breaker for early adopters?\n- Analyze journeys for MVP essentials\n\n**Nice-to-Have Analysis:**\n- Identify what could be added later:\n  - Features that enhance but aren't essential\n  - User types that can be added later\n  - Advanced functionality that builds on MVP\n- Ask what features could be added in versions 2, 3, etc.\n\n### 4. Progressive Feature Roadmap\n\nCreate phased development approach:\n- Guide mapping of features across development phases\n- Structure as Phase 1 (MVP), Phase 2 (Growth), Phase 3 (Vision)\n- Ensure clear progression and dependencies\n\n- Core user value delivery\n- Essential user journeys\n- Basic functionality that works reliably\n\n**Phase 2: Growth**\n\n- Additional user types\n- Enhanced features\n- Scale improvements\n\n**Phase 3: Expansion**\n\n- Advanced capabilities\n- Platform features\n- New markets or use cases\n\n**Where does your current vision fit in this development sequence?**\"\n\n### 5. Risk-Based Scoping\n\nIdentify and mitigate scoping risks:\n\n**Technical Risks:**\n\"Looking at your innovation and domain requirements:\n\n- What's the most technically challenging aspect?\n- Could we simplify the initial implementation?\n- What's the riskiest assumption about technology feasibility?\"\n\n**Market Risks:**\n\n- What's the biggest market risk?\n- How does the MVP address this?\n- What learning do we need to de-risk this?\"\n\n**Resource Risks:**\n\n- What if we have fewer resources than planned?\n- What's the absolute minimum team size needed?\n- Can we launch with a smaller feature set?\"\n\n### 6. Generate Scoping Content\n\nPrepare comprehensive scoping section:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\n```markdown\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** {{chosen_mvp_approach}}\n**Resource Requirements:** {{mvp_team_size_and_skills}}\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n{{essential_journeys_for_mvp}}\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n{{list_of_essential_mvp_features}}\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\n{{planned_growth_features}}\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\n{{planned_expansion_features}}\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** {{mitigation_approach}}\n**Market Risks:** {{validation_approach}}\n**Resource Risks:** {{contingency_approach}}\n```\n\n### 7. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nPresent the scoping decisions for review, then display menu:\n- Show strategic scoping plan (using structure from step 6)\n- Highlight MVP boundaries and phased roadmap\n- Ask if they'd like to refine further, get other perspectives, or proceed\n- Present menu options naturally as part of conversation\n\nDisplay: \"**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to Functional Requirements (Step 9 of 11)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n- IF A: Read fully and follow: {advancedElicitationTask} with the current scoping analysis, process the enhanced insights that come back, ask user if they accept the improvements, if yes update content then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF P: Read fully and follow: {partyModeWorkflow} with the scoping context, process the collaborative insights on MVP and roadmap decisions, ask user if they accept the changes, if yes update content then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF C: Append the final content to {outputFile}, update frontmatter by adding this step name to the end of the stepsCompleted array, then read fully and follow: {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other: help user respond, then redisplay menu\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution, return to this menu\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Complete PRD document analyzed for scope implications\n✅ Strategic MVP approach defined and justified\n✅ Clear MVP feature boundaries established\n✅ Phased development roadmap created\n✅ Key risks identified and mitigation strategies defined\n✅ User explicitly agrees to scope decisions\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not analyzing the complete PRD before making scoping decisions\n❌ Making scope decisions without strategic rationale\n❌ Not getting explicit user agreement on MVP boundaries\n❌ Missing critical risk analysis\n❌ Not creating clear phased development approach\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load {nextStepFile}.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-09 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Understand FR Purpose and Usage\n\nStart by explaining the critical role of functional requirements:\n\n**Purpose:**\nFRs define WHAT capabilities the product must have. They are the complete inventory of user-facing and system capabilities that deliver the product vision.\n\n**Critical Properties:**\n✅ Each FR is a testable capability\n✅ Each FR is implementation-agnostic (could be built many ways)\n✅ Each FR specifies WHO and WHAT, not HOW\n✅ No UI details, no performance numbers, no technology choices\n✅ Comprehensive coverage of capability areas\n\n**How They Will Be Used:**\n\n1. UX Designer reads FRs → designs interactions for each capability\n2. Architect reads FRs → designs systems to support each capability\n3. PM reads FRs → creates epics and stories to implement each capability\n\n### 2. Review Existing Content for Capability Extraction\n\nSystematically review all previous sections to extract capabilities:\n\n**Extract From:**\n\n- Executive Summary → Core product differentiator capabilities\n- Success Criteria → Success-enabling capabilities\n- User Journeys → Journey-revealed capabilities\n- Domain Requirements → Compliance and regulatory capabilities\n- Innovation Patterns → Innovative feature capabilities\n- Project-Type Requirements → Technical capability needs\n\n### 3. Organize Requirements by Capability Area\n\nGroup FRs by logical capability areas (NOT by technology or layer):\n\n**Good Grouping Examples:**\n\n- ✅ \"User Management\" (not \"Authentication System\")\n- ✅ \"Content Discovery\" (not \"Search Algorithm\")\n- ✅ \"Team Collaboration\" (not \"WebSocket Infrastructure\")\n\n**Target 5-8 Capability Areas** for typical projects.\n\n### 4. Generate Comprehensive FR List\n\nCreate complete functional requirements using this format:\n\n**Format:**\n\n- FR#: [Actor] can [capability] [context/constraint if needed]\n- Number sequentially (FR1, FR2, FR3...)\n- Aim for 20-50 FRs for typical projects\n\n**Altitude Check:**\nEach FR should answer \"WHAT capability exists?\" NOT \"HOW it's implemented?\"\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- ✅ \"Users can customize appearance settings\"\n- ❌ \"Users can toggle light/dark theme with 3 font size options stored in LocalStorage\"\n\n### 5. Self-Validation Process\n\nBefore presenting to user, validate the FR list:\n\n**Completeness Check:**\n\n1. \"Did I cover EVERY capability mentioned in the MVP scope section?\"\n2. \"Did I include domain-specific requirements as FRs?\"\n3. \"Did I cover the project-type specific needs?\"\n4. \"Could a UX designer read ONLY the FRs and know what to design?\"\n5. \"Could an Architect read ONLY the FRs and know what to support?\"\n6. \"Are there any user actions or system behaviors we discussed that have no FR?\"\n\n**Altitude Check:**\n\n1. \"Am I stating capabilities (WHAT) or implementation (HOW)?\"\n2. \"Am I listing acceptance criteria or UI specifics?\" (Remove if yes)\n3. \"Could this FR be implemented 5 different ways?\" (Good - means it's not prescriptive)\n\n**Quality Check:**\n\n1. \"Is each FR clear enough that someone could test whether it exists?\"\n2. \"Is each FR independent (not dependent on reading other FRs to understand)?\"\n3. \"Did I avoid vague terms like 'good', 'fast', 'easy'?\" (Use NFRs for quality attributes)\n\n### 6. Generate Functional Requirements Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### [Capability Area Name]\n\n- FR1: [Specific Actor] can [specific capability]\n- FR2: [Specific Actor] can [specific capability]\n- FR3: [Specific Actor] can [specific capability]\n\n### [Another Capability Area]\n\n- FR4: [Specific Actor] can [specific capability]\n- FR5: [Specific Actor] can [specific capability]\n\n[Continue for all capability areas discovered in conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nPresent the functional requirements for review, then display menu:\n- Show synthesized functional requirements (using structure from step 6)\n- Emphasize this is the capability contract for all downstream work\n- Highlight that every feature must trace back to these requirements\n- Ask if they'd like to refine further, get other perspectives, or proceed\n- Present menu options naturally as part of conversation\n\n**What would you like to do?**\"\n\nDisplay: \"**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to Non-Functional Requirements (Step 10 of 11)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n- IF A: Read fully and follow: {advancedElicitationTask} with the current FR list, process the enhanced capability coverage that comes back, ask user if they accept the additions, if yes update content then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF P: Read fully and follow: {partyModeWorkflow} with the current FR list, process the collaborative capability validation and additions, ask user if they accept the changes, if yes update content then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF C: Append the final content to {outputFile}, update frontmatter by adding this step name to the end of the stepsCompleted array, then read fully and follow: {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other: help user respond, then redisplay menu\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution, return to this menu\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ All previous discovery content synthesized into FRs\n✅ FRs organized by capability areas (not technology)\n✅ Each FR states WHAT capability exists, not HOW to implement\n✅ Comprehensive coverage with 20-50 FRs typical\n✅ Altitude validation ensures implementation-agnostic requirements\n✅ Completeness check validates coverage of all discussed capabilities\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Missing capabilities from previous discovery sections\n❌ Organizing FRs by technology instead of capability areas\n❌ Including implementation details or UI specifics in FRs\n❌ Not achieving comprehensive coverage of discussed capabilities\n❌ Using vague terms instead of testable capabilities\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## CAPABILITY CONTRACT REMINDER:\n\nEmphasize to user: \"This FR list is now binding. Any feature not listed here will not exist in the final product unless we explicitly add it. This is why it's critical to ensure completeness now.\"\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load {nextStepFile} to define non-functional requirements.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-10 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Explain NFR Purpose and Scope\n\nStart by clarifying what NFRs are and why we're selective:\n\n**NFR Purpose:**\nNFRs define HOW WELL the system must perform, not WHAT it must do. They specify quality attributes like performance, security, scalability, etc.\n\n**Selective Approach:**\nWe only document NFRs that matter for THIS product. If a category doesn't apply, we skip it entirely. This prevents requirement bloat and focuses on what's actually important.\n\n### 2. Assess Product Context for NFR Relevance\n\nEvaluate which NFR categories matter based on product context:\n\n**Quick Assessment Questions:**\n\n- **Performance**: Is there user-facing impact of speed?\n- **Security**: Are we handling sensitive data or payments?\n- **Scalability**: Do we expect rapid user growth?\n- **Accessibility**: Are we serving broad public audiences?\n- **Integration**: Do we need to connect with other systems?\n- **Reliability**: Would downtime cause significant problems?\n\n### 3. Explore Relevant NFR Categories\n\nFor each relevant category, conduct targeted discovery:\n\n#### Performance NFRs (If relevant):\n\nExplore performance requirements:\n- What parts of the system need to be fast for users to be successful?\n- Are there specific response time expectations?\n- What happens if performance is slower than expected?\n- Are there concurrent user scenarios we need to support?\n\n#### Security NFRs (If relevant):\n\nExplore security requirements:\n- What data needs to be protected?\n- Who should have access to what?\n- What are the security risks we need to mitigate?\n- Are there compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)?\n\n#### Scalability NFRs (If relevant):\n\nExplore scalability requirements:\n- How many users do we expect initially? Long-term?\n- Are there seasonal or event-based traffic spikes?\n- What happens if we exceed our capacity?\n- What growth scenarios should we plan for?\n\n#### Accessibility NFRs (If relevant):\n\nExplore accessibility requirements:\n- Are we serving users with visual, hearing, or motor impairments?\n- Are there legal accessibility requirements (WCAG, Section 508)?\n- What accessibility features are most important for our users?\n\n#### Integration NFRs (If relevant):\n\nExplore integration requirements:\n- What external systems do we need to connect with?\n- Are there APIs or data formats we must support?\n- How reliable do these integrations need to be?\n\n### 4. Make NFRs Specific and Measurable\n\nFor each relevant NFR category, ensure criteria are testable:\n\n**From Vague to Specific:**\n\n- NOT: \"The system should be fast\" → \"User actions complete within 2 seconds\"\n- NOT: \"The system should be secure\" → \"All data is encrypted at rest and in transit\"\n- NOT: \"The system should scale\" → \"System supports 10x user growth with <10% performance degradation\"\n\n### 5. Generate NFR Content (Only Relevant Categories)\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure (Dynamic based on relevance):\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections (only include sections that are relevant):\n\n```markdown\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Performance\n\n[Performance requirements based on conversation - only include if relevant]\n\n### Security\n\n[Security requirements based on conversation - only include if relevant]\n\n### Scalability\n\n[Scalability requirements based on conversation - only include if relevant]\n\n### Accessibility\n\n[Accessibility requirements based on conversation - only include if relevant]\n\n### Integration\n\n[Integration requirements based on conversation - only include if relevant]\n```\n\n### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nPresent the non-functional requirements for review, then display menu:\n- Show defined NFRs (using structure from step 5)\n- Note that only relevant categories were included\n- Emphasize NFRs specify how well the system needs to perform\n- Ask if they'd like to refine further, get other perspectives, or proceed\n- Present menu options naturally as part of conversation\n\nDisplay: \"**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to Polish Document (Step 11 of 12)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n- IF A: Read fully and follow: {advancedElicitationTask} with the current NFR content, process the enhanced quality attribute insights that come back, ask user if they accept the improvements, if yes update content then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF P: Read fully and follow: {partyModeWorkflow} with the current NFR list, process the collaborative technical validation and additions, ask user if they accept the changes, if yes update content then redisplay menu, if no keep original content then redisplay menu\n- IF C: Append the final content to {outputFile}, update frontmatter by adding this step name to the end of the stepsCompleted array, then read fully and follow: {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other: help user respond, then redisplay menu\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- After other menu items execution, return to this menu\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 5.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Only relevant NFR categories documented (no requirement bloat)\n✅ Each NFR is specific and measurable\n✅ NFRs connected to actual user needs and business context\n✅ Vague requirements converted to testable criteria\n✅ Domain-specific compliance requirements included if relevant\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Documenting NFR categories that don't apply to the product\n❌ Leaving requirements vague and unmeasurable\n❌ Not connecting NFRs to actual user or business needs\n❌ Missing domain-specific compliance requirements\n❌ Creating overly prescriptive technical requirements\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NFR CATEGORY GUIDANCE:\n\n**Include Performance When:**\n\n- User-facing response times impact success\n- Real-time interactions are critical\n- Performance is a competitive differentiator\n\n**Include Security When:**\n\n- Handling sensitive user data\n- Processing payments or financial information\n- Subject to compliance regulations\n- Protecting intellectual property\n\n**Include Scalability When:**\n\n- Expecting rapid user growth\n- Handling variable traffic patterns\n- Supporting enterprise-scale usage\n- Planning for market expansion\n\n**Include Accessibility When:**\n\n- Serving broad public audiences\n- Subject to accessibility regulations\n- Targeting users with disabilities\n- B2B customers with accessibility requirements\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load {nextStepFile} to finalize the PRD and complete the workflow.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-11 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Load Context and Document\n\n**CRITICAL:** Load the PRD purpose document first:\n\n- Read `{purposeFile}` to understand what makes a great BMAD PRD\n- Internalize the philosophy: information density, traceability, measurable requirements\n- Keep the dual-audience nature (humans + LLMs) in mind\n\n**Then Load the PRD Document:**\n\n- Read `{outputFile}` completely from start to finish\n- Understand the full document structure and content\n- Identify all sections and their relationships\n- Note areas that need attention\n\n### 2. Document Quality Review\n\nReview the entire document with PRD purpose principles in mind:\n\n**Information Density:**\n- Are there wordy phrases that can be condensed?\n- Is conversational padding present?\n- Can sentences be more direct and concise?\n\n**Flow and Coherence:**\n- Do sections transition smoothly?\n- Are there jarring topic shifts?\n- Does the document tell a cohesive story?\n- Is the progression logical for readers?\n\n**Duplication Detection:**\n- Are ideas repeated across sections?\n- Is the same information stated multiple times?\n- Can redundant content be consolidated?\n- Are there contradictory statements?\n\n**Header Structure:**\n- Are all main sections using ## Level 2 headers?\n- Is the hierarchy consistent (##, ###, ####)?\n- Can sections be easily extracted or referenced?\n- Are headers descriptive and clear?\n\n**Readability:**\n- Are sentences clear and concise?\n- Is the language consistent throughout?\n- Are technical terms used appropriately?\n- Would stakeholders find this easy to understand?\n\n### 3. Optimization Actions\n\nMake targeted improvements:\n\n**Improve Flow:**\n- Add transition sentences between sections\n- Smooth out jarring topic shifts\n- Ensure logical progression\n- Connect related concepts across sections\n\n**Reduce Duplication:**\n- Consolidate repeated information\n- Keep content in the most appropriate section\n- Use cross-references instead of repetition\n- Remove redundant explanations\n\n**Enhance Coherence:**\n- Ensure consistent terminology throughout\n- Align all sections with product differentiator\n- Maintain consistent voice and tone\n- Verify scope consistency across sections\n\n**Optimize Headers:**\n- Ensure all main sections use ## Level 2\n- Make headers descriptive and action-oriented\n- Check that headers follow consistent patterns\n- Verify headers support document navigation\n\n### 4. Preserve Critical Information\n\n**While optimizing, ensure NOTHING essential is lost:**\n\n**Must Preserve:**\n- All user success criteria\n- All functional requirements (capability contract)\n- All user journey narratives\n- All scope decisions (MVP, Growth, Vision)\n- All non-functional requirements\n- Product differentiator and vision\n- Domain-specific requirements\n- Innovation analysis (if present)\n\n**Can Consolidate:**\n- Repeated explanations of the same concept\n- Redundant background information\n- Multiple versions of similar content\n- Overlapping examples\n\n### 5. Generate Optimized Document\n\nCreate the polished version:\n\n**Polishing Process:**\n1. Start with original document\n2. Apply all optimization actions\n3. Review to ensure nothing essential was lost\n4. Verify improvements enhance readability\n5. Prepare optimized version for review\n\n### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nPresent the polished document for review, then display menu:\n- Show what changed in the polish\n- Highlight improvements made (flow, duplication, headers)\n- Ask if they'd like to refine further, get other perspectives, or proceed\n- Present menu options naturally as part of conversation\n\nDisplay: \"**Select:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to Complete PRD (Step 12 of 12)\"\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n- IF A: Read fully and follow: {advancedElicitationTask} with the polished document, process the enhanced refinements that come back, ask user \"Accept these polish improvements?

LLMs consume precise, dense content efficiently.\n\n**Anti-Patterns (Eliminate These):**\n- ❌ \"The system will allow users to...\" → ✅ \"Users can...\"\n- ❌ \"It is important to note that...\" → ✅ State the fact directly\n- ❌ \"In order to...\" → ✅ \"To...\"\n- ❌ Conversational filler and padding → ✅ Direct, concise statements\n\n**Goal:** Maximum information per word. Zero fluff.\n\n---\n\n## The Traceability Chain\n\n**PRD starts the chain:**\n```\nVision → Success Criteria → User Journeys → Functional Requirements → (future: User Stories)\n```\n\n**In the PRD, establish:**\n- Vision → Success Criteria alignment\n- Success Criteria → User Journey coverage\n- User Journey → Functional Requirement mapping\n- All requirements traceable to user needs\n\n**Why:** Each downstream artifact (UX, Architecture, Epics, Stories) must trace back to documented user needs and business objectives. This chain ensures we build the right thing.\n\n---\n\n## What Makes Great Functional Requirements?\n\n### FRs are Capabilities, Not Implementation\n\n**Good FR:** \"Users can reset their password via email link\"\n**Bad FR:** \"System sends JWT via email and validates with database\" (implementation leakage)\n\n**Good FR:** \"Dashboard loads in under 2 seconds for 95th percentile\"\n**Bad FR:** \"Fast loading time\" (subjective, unmeasurable)\n\n### SMART Quality Criteria\n\n**Specific:** Clear, precisely defined capability\n**Measurable:** Quantifiable with test criteria\n**Attainable:** Realistic within constraints\n**Relevant:** Aligns with business objectives\n**Traceable:** Links to source (executive summary or user journey)\n\n### FR Anti-Patterns\n\n**Subjective Adjectives:**\n- ❌ \"easy to use\", \"intuitive\", \"user-friendly\", \"fast\", \"responsive\"\n- ✅ Use metrics: \"completes task in under 3 clicks\", \"loads in under 2 seconds\"\n\n**Implementation Leakage:**\n- ❌ Technology names, specific libraries, implementation details\n- ✅ Focus on capability and measurable outcomes\n\n**Vague Quantifiers:**\n- ❌ \"multiple users\", \"several options\", \"various formats\"\n- ✅ \"up to 100 concurrent users\", \"3-5 options\", \"PDF, DOCX, TXT formats\"\n\n**Missing Test Criteria:**\n- ❌ \"The system shall provide notifications\"\n- ✅ \"The system shall send email notifications within 30 seconds of trigger event\"\n\n---\n\n## What Makes Great Non-Functional Requirements?\n\n### NFRs Must Be Measurable\n\n**Template:**\n```\n\"The system shall [metric] [condition] [measurement method]\"\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n- ✅ \"The system shall respond to API requests in under 200ms for 95th percentile as measured by APM monitoring\"\n- ✅ \"The system shall maintain 99.9% uptime during business hours as measured by cloud provider SLA\"\n- ✅ \"The system shall support 10,000 concurrent users as measured by load testing\"\n\n### NFR Anti-Patterns\n\n**Unmeasurable Claims:**\n- ❌ \"The system shall be scalable\" → ✅ \"The system shall handle 10x load growth through horizontal scaling\"\n- ❌ \"High availability required\" → ✅ \"99.9% uptime as measured by cloud provider SLA\"\n\n**Missing Context:**\n- ❌ \"Response time under 1 second\" → ✅ \"API response time under 1 second for 95th percentile under normal load\"\n\n---\n\n## Domain-Specific Requirements\n\n**Auto-Detect and Enforce Based on Project Context**\n\nCertain industries have mandatory requirements that must be present:\n\n- **Healthcare:** HIPAA Privacy & Security Rules, PHI encryption, audit logging, MFA\n- **Fintech:** PCI-DSS Level 1, AML/KYC compliance, SOX controls, financial audit trails\n- **GovTech:** NIST framework, Section 508 accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), FedRAMP, data residency\n- **E-Commerce:** PCI-DSS for payments, inventory accuracy, tax calculation by jurisdiction\n\n**Why:** Missing these requirements in the PRD means they'll be missed in architecture and implementation, creating expensive rework. During PRD creation there is a step to cover this - during validation we want to make sure it was covered. For this purpose steps will utilize a domain-complexity.csv and project-types.csv.\n\n---\n\n## Document Structure (Markdown, Human-Readable)\n\n### Required Sections\n1. **Executive Summary** - Vision, differentiator, target users\n2. **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes (SMART)\n3. **Product Scope** - MVP, Growth, Vision phases\n4. **User Journeys** - Comprehensive coverage\n5. **Domain Requirements** - Industry-specific compliance (if applicable)\n6. **Innovation Analysis** - Competitive differentiation (if applicable)\n7. **Project-Type Requirements** - Platform-specific needs\n8. **Functional Requirements** - Capability contract (FRs)\n9. **Non-Functional Requirements** - Quality attributes (NFRs)\n\n### Formatting for Dual Consumption\n\n**For Humans:**\n- Clear, professional language\n- Logical flow from vision to requirements\n- Easy for stakeholders to review and approve\n\n**For LLMs:**\n- ## Level 2 headers for all main sections (enables extraction)\n- Consistent structure and patterns\n- Precise, testable language\n- High information density\n\n---\n\n## Downstream Impact\n\n**How the PRD Feeds Next Artifacts:**\n\n**UX Design:**\n- User journeys → interaction flows\n- FRs → design requirements\n- Success criteria → UX metrics\n\n**Architecture:**\n- FRs → system capabilities\n- NFRs → architecture decisions\n- Domain requirements → compliance architecture\n- Project-type requirements → platform choices\n\n**Epics & Stories (created after architecture):**\n- FRs → user stories (1 FR could map to 1-3 stories potentially)\n- Acceptance criteria → story acceptance tests\n- Priority → sprint sequencing\n- Traceability → stories map back to vision\n\n**Development AI Agents:**\n- Precise requirements → implementation clarity\n- Test criteria → automated test generation\n- Domain requirements → compliance enforcement\n- Measurable NFRs → performance targets\n\n---\n\n## Summary: What Makes a Great BMAD PRD?\n\n✅ **High Information Density** - Every sentence carries weight, zero fluff\n✅ **Measurable Requirements** - All FRs and NFRs are testable with specific criteria\n✅ **Clear Traceability** - Each requirement links to user need and business objective\n✅ **Domain Awareness** - Industry-specific requirements auto-detected and included\n✅ **Zero Anti-Patterns** - No subjective adjectives, implementation leakage, or vague quantifiers\n✅ **Dual Audience Optimized** - Human-readable AND LLM-consumable\n✅ **Markdown Format** - Professional, clean, accessible to all stakeholders\n\n---\n\n**Remember:** The PRD is the foundation. Quality here ripples through every subsequent phase. A dense, precise, well-traced PRD makes UX design, architecture, epic breakdown, and AI development dramatically more effective.\n"}}

Un pipeline d'aide propose une extraction d'exigences et une strategie de tests structuree, que tu ajustes.\nEn conception, Squash est alimente par des propositions de cas de test pretes a relire, avec la checklist ESN integree.\nEn execution, tu lances la campagne ; les preuves video sont centralisees automatiquement et liees aux cas. Les anomalies se generent avec un template structure, preuves liees, et l'association Squash <-> Jira est fluide.\nEn fin de journee, le CR quotidien est pre-rempli (extraction Jira/Squash/Outlook), tu corriges et envoies en 5 minutes.\nLe mercredi, le PPT hebdo est pre-genere a partir des sources, tu ajustes les priorites et l'envoies.\nResultat : un rythme maitrise, une qualite percue superieure, et un effort mental reduit.\n\n### Journey 2 - Primary User - Edge Case \"jour qui deborde\"\n\nLe weekly deborde, les tickets sont volumineux et mal cadres. Tu risques la dispersion.\nLe systeme te ramene a un cadre industriel : tri automatique des tickets, alertes sur manque d'infos, actions proposees (clarification, demande MOA, report).\nIl suit la consommation de charge vs prevision, t'alerte avant la derive, et propose un plan de rattrapage (priorite, suspension, decalage).\nEn fin de journee, meme si tout part en vrille, le CR pre-rempli securise le rituel, evite le \"non-envoi\".\nResultat : tu gardes le controle, meme dans le chaos.\n\n### Journey 3 - Admin/Ops (toi) - Configuration et gouvernance\n\nTu ajustes les templates (anomalies, CR, PPT), les regles de checklist, les seuils KPI, et les sources de verite.\nTu ajoutes un nouveau perimetre, tu declares ses regles de nommage, et tu reutilises le pipeline existant.\nResultat : l'outillage est modulaire, maintenable, reutilisable.\n\n### Journey 4 - Support/Qualite - Investigation d'erreurs\n\nUne extraction ne colle pas. Tu consultes les logs de pipeline (quelle source, quelle transformation, quel mapping) et tu corriges.\nTu peux rejouer une extraction en mode diagnostic.\nResultat : transparence, fiabilite, et reduction des erreurs silencieuses.\n\n### Journey 5 - Reutilisation/Integration - Un autre projet branche la logique\n\nUn futur testeur clone le workflow, charge ses propres sources (Jira/Squash) et ses templates.\nLes modules sont interchangeables (reporting, checklist, anomalies, generation).\nResultat : transfert rapide, industrialisation multi-projets.\n\n### Journey 6 - TNR - Phase critique GO/NO-GO\n\nEn fin de lot, la campagne TNR est copiee et structuree automatiquement.\nLes anomalies TNR sont taguees, les preuves sont centralisees, et le PPT TNR est pre-rempli (GO/NO-GO, reserves, liens).\nResultat : decision finale plus fiable, moins de stress.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n\n- Pipeline d'extraction Jira/Squash/Outlook/Excel/PPT -> pre-remplissage CR et PPT\n- Checklist testabilite + scoring Go / Clarify / No-Go\n- Generation de brouillons (cas de tests, anomalies) avec LLM local\n- Tracabilite complete preuves <-> cas <-> anomalies <-> tickets\n- Modules reutilisables + configuration par projet\n- Logs/diagnostics et mode replay\n- Gestion charge vs prevision + alertes\n- Support TNR (campagne, tags, reporting GO/NO-GO)\n\n## Domain-Specific Requirements\n\n### Compliance & Regulatory\n- Usage IA sensible : LLM local prioritaire, cloud possible mais jamais sans anonymisation automatique.\n- Mecanisme d'anonymisation by design avant tout envoi vers un LLM cloud.\n- Aucune donnee sensible (clients finaux) ne doit sortir du perimetre sans masquage.\n\n### Technical Constraints\n- Jira : API token OK (hors VM).\n- Squash : Basic auth au depart (token a demander).\n- Least privilege : demarrage read-only, ecriture apres validation.\n- Secrets dans un coffre/secret store, jamais en clair.\n- HTTPS/TLS pour API ; Squash en HTTP probable (a faire evoluer).\n- Stockage au repos sur SharePoint ; donnees locales minimisees, chiffrees, purges.\n- Audit logs minimaux : horodatage, perimetre, version, statut, sans donnees sensibles.\n- Restrictions IT a confirmer : scripts signes/macros, droits install, proxy, appels externes.\n- Execution idealement sur environnement approuve (poste + M365), VM reservee aux applis testees.\n\n### Integration Requirements\n- Critiques : Jira + Squash (sources de verite), SharePoint (preuves/livrables), Excel & PowerPoint (CR + reporting).\n- Souhaitees : Outlook + Teams pour diffusion et recuperation d'infos reunions.\n- Jira : API OK, tokens OK.\n- Squash : API OK en Basic, token non dispo immediatement.\n\n### Risk Mitigations\n- Squash token manquant : demarrage en Basic, plan d'evolution.\n- Outlook/Teams API possiblement restreints : risque sur automatisation diffusion.\n- Cloud LLM : risque privacy -> anonymisation automatique + option LLM local.\n\n## Innovation & Novel Patterns\n\n### Detected Innovation Areas\n- Exploitation des preuves video pour detecter des ecarts avec les cas de test et proposer des ameliorations de redaction (priorite d'innovation).\n- LLM local integre au workflow : CLI conversationnel + etapes automatiques dans le pipeline selon le contexte.\n- Pipeline d'industrialisation reutilisable multi-projets (modules interchangeables).\n\n### Market Context & Competitive Landscape\n- Innovation interne : peu d'outillage TRA combine Jira/Squash/SharePoint et IA locale de maniere integree.\n- Differenciation via l'usage des preuves video pour ameliorer la qualite des cas de test.\n\n### Validation Approach\n- Prouver la valeur sur un lot pilote : reduction des erreurs de reporting et gain de temps sans perte de qualite.\n- Valider l'assistant LLM local sur un sous-ensemble de tickets et cas de test, avec relecture humaine obligatoire.\n- Valider la detection d'ecarts via preuves video sur un echantillon limite avant generalisation.\n\n### Risk Mitigation\n- Si l'IA video est trop complexe : fallback sur pipeline d'amelioration manuelle assistee.\n- Si l'IA locale est insuffisante : option cloud avec anonymisation automatique.\n- Si resistance au changement : activer en mode opt-in et comparer performances avant/apres.\n\n## CLI Tool Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n- Outil CLI interactif et scriptable, destine a industrialiser les flux QA (reporting, checklist, generation de brouillons).\n- Usage multi-projets avec profils et configuration reutilisable.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n- Modes d'execution : assistant interactif + batch/script.\n- Sorties multi-formats : texte, JSON, CSV, Markdown, HTML, YAML.\n- Separation stricte des secrets via secret store / env vars.\n\n### Command Structure\n- Commandes principales orientees workflow (triage, design, execute, report, tnr).\n- Sous-commandes pour extraction, generation, publication, diagnostics.\n\n### Output Formats\n- Selection via flag (--format json|csv|md|html|yaml|text).\n- Mode par defaut humain lisible + option machine-readable.\n\n### Config Schema\n- config.yaml par projet comme source principale.\n- Overrides via env vars + flags CLI.\n- Profiles pour basculer de contexte (--profile tra-dev).\n\n### Scripting Support\n- Codes de sortie normalises (succes/echec).\n- Mode non-interactif (--yes, --dry-run, --no-llm).\n\n### Shell Completion\n- Auto-completion Bash/Zsh (commandes + flags + profils).\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n- Logging minimal (sans donnees sensibles).\n- Support LLM local + fallback cloud (avec anonymisation).\n\n## Project Scoping & Phased Development\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n\n**MVP Approach:** Problem MVP + Platform MVP\n**Resource Requirements:** 1 personne (toi) + acces API + secret store + config multi-profils\n\n### MVP Feature Set (Phase 1)\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n- Parcours \"jour maitrise\" (triage -> devis -> conception -> execution -> CR)\n- Parcours \"edge case\" avec garde-fous + CR securise\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n- Checklist testabilite + score Go / Clarify / No-Go\n- Templates anomalies + preuves standardisees\n- Extraction Jira/Squash -> pre-remplissage CR quotidien\n- Generation de brouillons (cas de tests / anomalies) via LLM local\n- config.yaml + profils + secret store (base reutilisable)\n\n### Post-MVP Features\n\n**Phase 2 (Post-MVP):**\n- Auto-remplissage PPT hebdo (structure fixe)\n- Source unique et standardisation des metriques\n- Suggestions Squash (reutilisation assets)\n- Notifications Teams/Outlook si APIs OK\n- Dashboards simples (KPI)\n\n**Phase 3 (Expansion):**\n- IA sur preuves video pour ameliorer les cas de test\n- Score qualite / fiabilite continu des tickets\n- Planification intelligente (cadence QA/HO)\n- Analyse historique multi-lots\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n\n**Technical Risks:** integration preuves video + qualite IA -> valider sur echantillon avant generalisation\n**Market Risks:** resistance aux templates/process -> mode opt-in + comparaison avant/apres\n**Resource Risks:** acces API / droits IT / temps -> prioriser MVP auto-contenu + fallback manuel\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### Ingestion & Triage\n- FR1: L'utilisateur peut importer des tickets depuis Jira pour une periode ou un

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Les emails sont tries rapidement, puis le weekly TRA aligne les priorites. Le planning mensuel te donne une trajectoire claire.\\nEn phase devis, les tickets Jira passent par une checklist testabilite : ceux qui ne sont pas \\\"ready\\\" sont immediatement identifies. Un pipeline d'aide propose une extraction d'exigences et une strategie de tests structuree, que tu ajustes.\\nEn conception, Squash est alimente par des propositions de cas de test pretes a relire, avec la checklist ESN integree.\\nEn execution, tu lances la campagne ; les preuves video sont centralisees automatiquement et liees aux cas. Les anomalies se generent avec un template structure, preuves liees, et l'association Squash <-> Jira est fluide.\\nEn fin de journee, le CR quotidien est pre-rempli (extraction Jira/Squash/Outlook), tu corriges et envoies en 5 minutes.\\nLe mercredi, le PPT hebdo est pre-genere a partir des sources, tu ajustes les priorites et l'envoies.\\nResultat : un rythme maitrise, une qualite percue superieure, et un effort mental reduit.\\n\\n### Journey 2 - Primary User - Edge Case \\\"jour qui deborde\\\"\\nLe weekly deborde, les tickets sont volumineux et mal cadres. Tu risques la dispersion.\\nLe systeme te ramene a un cadre industriel : tri automatique des tickets, alertes sur manque d'infos, actions proposees (clarification, demande MOA, report).\\nIl suit la consommation de charge vs prevision, t'alerte avant la derive, et propose un plan de rattrapage (priorite, suspension, decalage).\\nEn fin de journee, meme si tout part en vrille, le CR pre-rempli securise le rituel, evite le \\\"non-envoi\\\".\\nResultat : tu gardes le controle, meme dans le chaos.\\n\\n### Journey 3 - Admin/Ops (toi) - Configuration et gouvernance\\nTu ajustes les templates (anomalies, CR, PPT), les regles de checklist, les seuils KPI, et les sources de verite.\\nTu ajoutes un nouveau perimetre, tu declares ses regles de nommage, et tu reutilises le pipeline existant.\\nResultat : l'outillage est modulaire, maintenable, reutilisable.\\n\\n### Journey 4 - Support/Qualite - Investigation d'erreurs\\nUne extraction ne colle pas. Tu consultes les logs de pipeline (quelle source, quelle transformation, quel mapping) et tu corriges.\\nTu peux rejouer une extraction en mode diagnostic.\\nResultat : transparence, fiabilite, et reduction des erreurs silencieuses.\\n\\n### Journey 5 - Reutilisation/Integration - Un autre projet branche la logique\\nUn futur testeur clone le workflow, charge ses propres sources (Jira/Squash) et ses templates.\\nLes modules sont interchangeables (reporting, checklist, anomalies, generation).\\nResultat : transfert rapide, industrialisation multi-projets.\\n\\n### Journey 6 - TNR - Phase critique GO/NO-GO\\nEn fin de lot, la campagne TNR est copiee et structuree automatiquement.\\nLes anomalies TNR sont taguees, les preuves sont centralisees, et le PPT TNR est pre-rempli (GO/NO-GO, reserves, liens).\\nResultat : decision finale plus fiable, moins de stress.\\n\\n### Journey Requirements Summary\\n- Pipeline d'extraction Jira/Squash/Outlook/Excel/PPT -> pre-remplissage CR et PPT\\n- Checklist testabilite + scoring Go / Clarify / No-Go\\n- Generation de brouillons (cas de tests, anomalies) avec LLM local\\n- Tracabilite complete preuves <-> cas <-> anomalies <-> tickets\\n- Modules reutilisables + configuration par projet\\n- Logs/diagnostics et mode replay\\n- Gestion charge vs prevision + alertes\\n- Support TNR (campagne, tags, reporting GO/NO-GO)\\n\\n## Domain-Specific Requirements\\n\\n### Compliance & Regulatory\\n- Usage IA sensible : LLM local prioritaire, cloud possible mais jamais sans anonymisation automatique.\\n- Mecanisme d'anonymisation by design avant tout envoi vers un LLM cloud.\\n- Aucune donnee sensible (clients finaux) ne doit sortir du perimetre sans masquage.\\n\\n### Technical Constraints\\n- Jira : API token OK (hors VM).\\n- Squash : Basic auth au depart (token a demander).\\n- Least privilege : demarrage read-only, ecriture apres validation.\\n- Secrets dans un coffre/secret store, jamais en clair.\\n- HTTPS/TLS pour API ; Squash en HTTP probable (a faire evoluer).\\n- Stockage au repos sur SharePoint ; donnees locales minimisees, chiffrees, purges.\\n- Audit logs minimaux : horodatage, perimetre, version, statut, sans donnees sensibles.\\n- Restrictions IT a confirmer : scripts signes/macros, droits install, proxy, appels externes.\\n- Execution idealement sur environnement approuve (poste + M365), VM reservee aux applis testees.\\n\\n### Integration Requirements\\n- Critiques : Jira + Squash (sources de verite), SharePoint (preuves/livrables), Excel & PowerPoint (CR + reporting).\\n- Souhaitees : Outlook + Teams pour diffusion et recuperation d'infos reunions.\\n- Jira : API OK, tokens OK.\\n- Squash : API OK en Basic, token non dispo immediatement.\\n\\n### Risk Mitigations\\n- Squash token manquant :

Announce Workflow Completion\n\nInform user that the PRD is complete and polished:\n- Celebrate successful completion of comprehensive PRD\n- Summarize all sections that were created\n- Highlight that document has been polished for flow and coherence\n- Emphasize document is ready for downstream work\n\n### 2. Workflow Status Update\n\nUpdate the main workflow status file if there is one:\n\n- Load `{status_file}` from workflow configuration (if exists)\n- Update workflow_status[\"prd\"] = \"{default_output_file}\"\n- Save file, preserving all comments and structure\n- Mark current timestamp as completion time\n\n### 3.

Suggest Next Workflows\n\nPRD complete. Read fully and follow: `_bmad/core/tasks/bmad-help.md` with argument `Create PRD`.\n\n### 5. Final Completion Confirmation\n\n- Confirm completion with user and summarize what has been accomplished\n- Document now contains: Executive Summary, Success Criteria, User Journeys, Domain Requirements (if applicable), Innovation Analysis (if applicable), Project-Type Requirements, Functional Requirements (capability contract), Non-Functional Requirements, and has been polished for flow and coherence\n- Ask if they'd like to run validation workflow or proceed to next workflows\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ PRD document contains all required sections and has been polished\n✅ All collaborative content properly saved and optimized\n✅ Workflow status file updated with completion information (if exists)\n✅ Validation workflow options clearly presented\n✅ Clear next step guidance provided to user\n✅ Document quality validation completed\n✅ User acknowledges completion and understands next options\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not updating workflow status file with completion information (if exists)\n❌ Not offering validation workflow options\n❌ Missing clear next step guidance for user\n❌ Not confirming document completeness with user\n❌ Workflow not properly marked as complete in status tracking (if applicable)\n❌ User unclear about what happens next or what validation options exist\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## FINAL REMINDER to give the user:\n\nThe polished PRD serves as the foundation for all subsequent product development activities. All design, architecture, and development work should trace back to the requirements and vision documented in this PRD - update it also as needed as you continue planning.\n\n**Congratulations on completing the Product Requirements Document for {{project_name}}!** 🎉\n"}}

Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.\n\n### 1. Load PRD Purpose and Standards\n\nLoad and read the complete file at:\n`{prdPurpose}`\n\nThis file contains the BMAD PRD philosophy, standards, and validation criteria that will guide all validation checks. Internalize this understanding - it defines what makes a great BMAD PRD.\n\n### 2. Discover PRD to Validate\n\n**If PRD path provided as invocation parameter:**\n- Use provided path\n\n**If no PRD path provided:**\n\"**PRD Validation Workflow**\n\nWhich PRD would you like to validate?\n\nPlease provide the path to the PRD file you want to validate.\"\n\n**Wait for user to provide PRD path.**\n\n### 3. Validate PRD Exists and Load\n\nOnce PRD path is provided:\n\n- Check if PRD file exists at specified path\n- If not found: \"I cannot find a PRD at that path. Please check the path and try again.\"\n- If found: Load the complete PRD file including frontmatter\n\n### 4. Extract Frontmatter and Input Documents\n\nFrom the loaded PRD frontmatter, extract:\n\n- `inputDocuments: []` array (if present)\n- Any other relevant metadata (classification, date, etc.)\n\n**If no inputDocuments array exists:**\nNote this and proceed with PRD-only validation\n\n### 5. Load Input Documents\n\nFor each document listed in `inputDocuments`:\n\n- Attempt to load the document\n- Track successfully loaded documents\n- Note any documents that fail to load\n\n**Build list of loaded input documents:**\n- Product Brief (if present)\n- Research documents (if present)\n- Other reference materials (if present)\n\n### 6. Ask About Additional Reference Documents\n\n\"**I've loaded the following documents from your PRD frontmatter:**\n\n{list loaded documents with file names}\n\n**Are there any additional reference documents you'd like me to include in this validation?**\n\nThese could include:\n- Additional research or context documents\n- Project documentation not tracked in frontmatter\n- Standards or compliance documents\n- Competitive analysis or benchmarks\n\nPlease provide paths to any additional documents, or type 'none' to proceed.\"\n\n**Load any additional documents provided by user.**\n\n### 7. Initialize Validation Report\n\nCreate validation report at: `{validationReportPath}`\n\n**Initialize with frontmatter:**\n```yaml\n---\nvalidationTarget: '{prd_path}'\nvalidationDate: '{current_date}'\ninputDocuments: [list of all loaded documents]\nvalidationStepsCompleted: []\nvalidationStatus: IN_PROGRESS\n---\n```\n\n**Initial content:**\n```markdown\n# PRD Validation Report\n\n**PRD Being Validated:** {prd_path}\n**Validation Date:** {current_date}\n\n## Input Documents\n\n{list all documents loaded for validation}\n\n## Validation Findings\n\n[Findings will be appended as validation progresses]\n```\n\n### 8. Present Discovery Summary\n\n\"**Setup Complete!**\n\n**PRD to Validate:** {prd_path}\n\n**Input Documents Loaded:**\n- PRD: {prd_name} ✓\n- Product Brief: {count} {if count > 0}✓{else}(none found){/if}\n- Research: {count} {if count > 0}✓{else}(none found){/if}\n- Additional References: {count} {if count > 0}✓{else}(none){/if}\n\n**Validation Report:** {validationReportPath}\n\n**Ready to begin validation.**\"\n\n### 9. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nDisplay: **Select an Option:** [A] Advanced Elicitation [P] Party Mode [C] Continue to Format Detection\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed to next step when user selects 'C'\n- User can ask questions or add more documents - always respond and redisplay menu\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF A: Read fully and follow: {advancedElicitationTask}, and when finished redisplay the menu\n- IF P: Read fully and follow: {partyModeWorkflow}, and when finished redisplay the menu\n- IF C: Read fully and follow: {nextStepFile} to begin format detection\n- IF user provides additional document: Load it, update report, redisplay summary\n- IF Any other: help user, then redisplay menu\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- PRD path discovered and confirmed\n- PRD file exists and loads successfully\n- All input documents from frontmatter loaded\n- Additional reference documents (if any) loaded\n- Validation report initialized next to PRD\n- User clearly informed of setup status\n- Menu presented and user input handled correctly\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Proceeding with non-existent PRD file\n- Not loading input documents from frontmatter\n- Creating validation report in wrong location\n- Proceeding without user confirming setup\n- Not handling missing input documents gracefully\n\n**Master Rule:** Complete discovery and setup BEFORE validation. This step ensures everything is in place for systematic validation checks.\n"}}

LLMs consume precise, dense content efficiently.\n\n**Anti-Patterns (Eliminate These):**\n- ❌ \"The system will allow users to...\" → ✅ \"Users can...\"\n- ❌ \"It is important to note that...\" → ✅ State the fact directly\n- ❌ \"In order to...\" → ✅ \"To...\"\n- ❌ Conversational filler and padding → ✅ Direct, concise statements\n\n**Goal:** Maximum information per word. Zero fluff.\n\n---\n\n## The Traceability Chain\n\n**PRD starts the chain:**\n```\nVision → Success Criteria → User Journeys → Functional Requirements → (future: User Stories)\n```\n\n**In the PRD, establish:**\n- Vision → Success Criteria alignment\n- Success Criteria → User Journey coverage\n- User Journey → Functional Requirement mapping\n- All requirements traceable to user needs\n\n**Why:** Each downstream artifact (UX, Architecture, Epics, Stories) must trace back to documented user needs and business objectives. This chain ensures we build the right thing.\n\n---\n\n## What Makes Great Functional Requirements?\n\n### FRs are Capabilities, Not Implementation\n\n**Good FR:** \"Users can reset their password via email link\"\n**Bad FR:** \"System sends JWT via email and validates with database\" (implementation leakage)\n\n**Good FR:** \"Dashboard loads in under 2 seconds for 95th percentile\"\n**Bad FR:** \"Fast loading time\" (subjective, unmeasurable)\n\n### SMART Quality Criteria\n\n**Specific:** Clear, precisely defined capability\n**Measurable:** Quantifiable with test criteria\n**Attainable:** Realistic within constraints\n**Relevant:** Aligns with business objectives\n**Traceable:** Links to source (executive summary or user journey)\n\n### FR Anti-Patterns\n\n**Subjective Adjectives:**\n- ❌ \"easy to use\", \"intuitive\", \"user-friendly\", \"fast\", \"responsive\"\n- ✅ Use metrics: \"completes task in under 3 clicks\", \"loads in under 2 seconds\"\n\n**Implementation Leakage:**\n- ❌ Technology names, specific libraries, implementation details\n- ✅ Focus on capability and measurable outcomes\n\n**Vague Quantifiers:**\n- ❌ \"multiple users\", \"several options\", \"various formats\"\n- ✅ \"up to 100 concurrent users\", \"3-5 options\", \"PDF, DOCX, TXT formats\"\n\n**Missing Test Criteria:**\n- ❌ \"The system shall provide notifications\"\n- ✅ \"The system shall send email notifications within 30 seconds of trigger event\"\n\n---\n\n## What Makes Great Non-Functional Requirements?\n\n### NFRs Must Be Measurable\n\n**Template:**\n```\n\"The system shall [metric] [condition] [measurement method]\"\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n- ✅ \"The system shall respond to API requests in under 200ms for 95th percentile as measured by APM monitoring\"\n- ✅ \"The system shall maintain 99.9% uptime during business hours as measured by cloud provider SLA\"\n- ✅ \"The system shall support 10,000 concurrent users as measured by load testing\"\n\n### NFR Anti-Patterns\n\n**Unmeasurable Claims:**\n- ❌ \"The system shall be scalable\" → ✅ \"The system shall handle 10x load growth through horizontal scaling\"\n- ❌ \"High availability required\" → ✅ \"99.9% uptime as measured by cloud provider SLA\"\n\n**Missing Context:**\n- ❌ \"Response time under 1 second\" → ✅ \"API response time under 1 second for 95th percentile under normal load\"\n\n---\n\n## Domain-Specific Requirements\n\n**Auto-Detect and Enforce Based on Project Context**\n\nCertain industries have mandatory requirements that must be present:\n\n- **Healthcare:** HIPAA Privacy & Security Rules, PHI encryption, audit logging, MFA\n- **Fintech:** PCI-DSS Level 1, AML/KYC compliance, SOX controls, financial audit trails\n- **GovTech:** NIST framework, Section 508 accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), FedRAMP, data residency\n- **E-Commerce:** PCI-DSS for payments, inventory accuracy, tax calculation by jurisdiction\n\n**Why:** Missing these requirements in the PRD means they'll be missed in architecture and implementation, creating expensive rework. During PRD creation there is a step to cover this - during validation we want to make sure it was covered. For this purpose steps will utilize a domain-complexity.csv and project-types.csv.\n\n---\n\n## Document Structure (Markdown, Human-Readable)\n\n### Required Sections\n1. **Executive Summary** - Vision, differentiator, target users\n2. **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes (SMART)\n3. **Product Scope** - MVP, Growth, Vision phases\n4. **User Journeys** - Comprehensive coverage\n5. **Domain Requirements** - Industry-specific compliance (if applicable)\n6. **Innovation Analysis** - Competitive differentiation (if applicable)\n7. **Project-Type Requirements** - Platform-specific needs\n8. **Functional Requirements** - Capability contract (FRs)\n9. **Non-Functional Requirements** - Quality attributes (NFRs)\n\n### Formatting for Dual Consumption\n\n**For Humans:**\n- Clear, professional language\n- Logical flow from vision to requirements\n- Easy for stakeholders to review and approve\n\n**For LLMs:**\n- ## Level 2 headers for all main sections (enables extraction)\n- Consistent structure and patterns\n- Precise, testable language\n- High information density\n\n---\n\n## Downstream Impact\n\n**How the PRD Feeds Next Artifacts:**\n\n**UX Design:**\n- User journeys → interaction flows\n- FRs → design requirements\n- Success criteria → UX metrics\n\n**Architecture:**\n- FRs → system capabilities\n- NFRs → architecture decisions\n- Domain requirements → compliance architecture\n- Project-type requirements → platform choices\n\n**Epics & Stories (created after architecture):**\n- FRs → user stories (1 FR could map to 1-3 stories potentially)\n- Acceptance criteria → story acceptance tests\n- Priority → sprint sequencing\n- Traceability → stories map back to vision\n\n**Development AI Agents:**\n- Precise requirements → implementation clarity\n- Test criteria → automated test generation\n- Domain requirements → compliance enforcement\n- Measurable NFRs → performance targets\n\n---\n\n## Summary: What Makes a Great BMAD PRD?\n\n✅ **High Information Density** - Every sentence carries weight, zero fluff\n✅ **Measurable Requirements** - All FRs and NFRs are testable with specific criteria\n✅ **Clear Traceability** - Each requirement links to user need and business objective\n✅ **Domain Awareness** - Industry-specific requirements auto-detected and included\n✅ **Zero Anti-Patterns** - No subjective adjectives, implementation leakage, or vague quantifiers\n✅ **Dual Audience Optimized** - Human-readable AND LLM-consumable\n✅ **Markdown Format** - Professional, clean, accessible to all stakeholders\n\n---\n\n**Remember:** The PRD is the foundation. Quality here ripples through every subsequent phase. A dense, precise, well-traced PRD makes UX design, architecture, epic breakdown, and AI development dramatically more effective.\n"}}

Un pipeline d'aide propose une extraction d'exigences et une strategie de tests structuree, que tu ajustes.\nEn conception, Squash est alimente par des propositions de cas de test pretes a relire, avec la checklist ESN integree.\nEn execution, tu lances la campagne ; les preuves video sont centralisees automatiquement et liees aux cas. Les anomalies se generent avec un template structure, preuves liees, et l'association Squash <-> Jira est fluide.\nEn fin de journee, le CR quotidien est pre-rempli (extraction Jira/Squash/Outlook), tu corriges et envoies en 5 minutes.\nLe mercredi, le PPT hebdo est pre-genere a partir des sources, tu ajustes les priorites et l'envoies.\nResultat : un rythme maitrise, une qualite percue superieure, et un effort mental reduit.\n\n### Journey 2 - Primary User - Edge Case \"jour qui deborde\"\nLe weekly deborde, les tickets sont volumineux et mal cadres. Tu risques la dispersion.\nLe systeme te ramene a un cadre industriel : tri automatique des tickets, alertes sur manque d'infos, actions proposees (clarification, demande MOA, report).\nIl suit la consommation de charge vs prevision, t'alerte avant la derive, et propose un plan de rattrapage (priorite, suspension, decalage).\nEn fin de journee, meme si tout part en vrille, le CR pre-rempli securise le rituel, evite le \"non-envoi\".\nResultat : tu gardes le controle, meme dans le chaos.\n\n### Journey 3 - Admin/Ops (toi) - Configuration et gouvernance\nTu ajustes les templates (anomalies, CR, PPT), les regles de checklist, les seuils KPI, et les sources de verite.\nTu ajoutes un nouveau perimetre, tu declares ses regles de nommage, et tu reutilises le pipeline existant.\nResultat : l'outillage est modulaire, maintenable, reutilisable.\n\n### Journey 4 - Support/Qualite - Investigation d'erreurs\nUne extraction ne colle pas. Tu consultes les logs de pipeline (quelle source, quelle transformation, quel mapping) et tu corriges.\nTu peux rejouer une extraction en mode diagnostic.\nResultat : transparence, fiabilite, et reduction des erreurs silencieuses.\n\n### Journey 5 - Reutilisation/Integration - Un autre projet branche la logique\nUn futur testeur clone le workflow, charge ses propres sources (Jira/Squash) et ses templates.\nLes modules sont interchangeables (reporting, checklist, anomalies, generation).\nResultat : transfert rapide, industrialisation multi-projets.\n\n### Journey 6 - TNR - Phase critique GO/NO-GO\nEn fin de lot, la campagne TNR est copiee et structuree automatiquement.\nLes anomalies TNR sont taguees, les preuves sont centralisees, et le PPT TNR est pre-rempli (GO/NO-GO, reserves, liens).\nResultat : decision finale plus fiable, moins de stress.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n- Pipeline d'extraction Jira/Squash/Outlook/Excel/PPT -> pre-remplissage CR et PPT\n- Checklist testabilite + scoring Go / Clarify / No-Go\n- Generation de brouillons (cas de tests, anomalies) avec LLM local\n- Tracabilite complete preuves <-> cas <-> anomalies <-> tickets\n- Modules reutilisables + configuration par projet\n- Logs/diagnostics et mode replay\n- Gestion charge vs prevision + alertes\n- Support TNR (campagne, tags, reporting GO/NO-GO)\n\n## Domain-Specific Requirements\n\n### Compliance & Regulatory\n- Usage IA sensible : LLM local prioritaire, cloud possible mais jamais sans anonymisation automatique.\n- Mecanisme d'anonymisation by design avant tout envoi vers un LLM cloud.\n- Aucune donnee sensible (clients finaux) ne doit sortir du perimetre sans masquage.\n\n### Technical Constraints\n- Jira : API token OK (hors VM).\n- Squash : Basic auth au depart (token a demander).\n- Least privilege : demarrage read-only, ecriture apres validation.\n- Secrets dans un coffre/secret store, jamais en clair.\n- HTTPS/TLS pour API ; Squash en HTTP probable (a faire evoluer).\n- Stockage au repos sur SharePoint ; donnees locales minimisees, chiffrees, purges.\n- Audit logs minimaux : horodatage, perimetre, version, statut, sans donnees sensibles.\n- Restrictions IT a confirmer : scripts signes/macros, droits install, proxy, appels externes.\n- Execution idealement sur environnement approuve (poste + M365), VM reservee aux applis testees.\n\n### Integration Requirements\n- Critiques : Jira + Squash (sources de verite), SharePoint (preuves/livrables), Excel & PowerPoint (CR + reporting).\n- Souhaitees : Outlook + Teams pour diffusion et recuperation d'infos reunions.\n- Jira : API OK, tokens OK.\n- Squash : API OK en Basic, token non dispo immediatement.\n\n### Risk Mitigations\n- Squash token manquant : demarrage en Basic, plan d'evolution.\n- Outlook/Teams API possiblement restreints : risque sur automatisation diffusion.\n- Cloud LLM : risque privacy -> anonymisation automatique + option LLM local.\n\n## Innovation & Novel Patterns\n\n### Detected Innovation Areas\n- Exploitation des preuves video pour detecter des ecarts avec les cas de test et proposer des ameliorations de redaction (priorite d'innovation).\n- LLM local integre au workflow : CLI conversationnel + etapes automatiques dans le pipeline selon le contexte.\n- Pipeline d'industrialisation reutilisable multi-projets (modules interchangeables).\n\n### Market Context & Competitive Landscape\n- Innovation interne : peu d'outillage TRA combine Jira/Squash/SharePoint et IA locale de maniere integree.\n- Differenciation via l'usage des preuves video pour ameliorer la qualite des cas de test.\n\n### Validation Approach\n- Prouver la valeur sur un lot pilote : reduction des erreurs de reporting et gain de temps sans perte de qualite.\n- Valider l'assistant LLM local sur un sous-ensemble de tickets et cas de test, avec relecture humaine obligatoire.\n- Valider la detection d'ecarts via preuves video sur un echantillon limite avant generalisation.\n\n### Risk Mitigation\n- Si l'IA video est trop complexe : fallback sur pipeline d'amelioration manuelle assistee.\n- Si l'IA locale est insuffisante : option cloud avec anonymisation automatique.\n- Si resistance au changement : activer en mode opt-in et comparer performances avant/apres.\n\n## CLI Tool Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n- Outil CLI interactif et

Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.\n\n### 1. Extract PRD Structure\n\nLoad the complete PRD file and extract:\n\n**All Level 2 (##) headers:**\n- Scan through entire PRD document\n- Extract all ## section headers\n- List them in order\n\n**PRD frontmatter:**\n- Extract classification.domain if present\n- Extract classification.projectType if present\n- Note any other relevant metadata\n\n### 2. Check for BMAD PRD Core Sections\n\nCheck if the PRD contains the following BMAD PRD core sections:\n\n1. **Executive Summary** (or variations: ## Executive Summary, ## Overview, ## Introduction)\n2. **Success Criteria** (or: ## Success Criteria, ## Goals, ## Objectives)\n3. **Product Scope** (or: ## Product Scope, ## Scope, ## In Scope, ## Out of Scope)\n4. **User Journeys** (or: ## User Journeys, ## User Stories, ## User Flows)\n5. **Functional Requirements** (or: ## Functional Requirements, ## Features, ## Capabilities)\n6. **Non-Functional Requirements** (or: ## Non-Functional Requirements, ## NFRs, ## Quality Attributes)\n\n**Count matches:**\n- How many of these 6 core sections are present?\n- Which specific sections are present?\n- Which are missing?\n\n### 3. Classify PRD Format\n\nBased on core section count, classify:\n\n**BMAD Standard:**\n- 5-6 core sections present\n- Follows BMAD PRD structure closely\n\n**BMAD Variant:**\n- 3-4 core sections present\n- Generally follows BMAD patterns but may have structural differences\n- Missing some sections but recognizable as BMAD-style\n\n**Non-Standard:**\n- Fewer than 3 core sections present\n- Does not follow BMAD PRD structure\n- May be completely custom format, legacy format, or from another framework\n\n### 4. Report Format Findings to Validation Report\n\nAppend to validation report:\n\n```markdown\n## Format Detection\n\n**PRD Structure:**\n[List all ## Level 2 headers found]\n\n**BMAD Core Sections Present:**\n- Executive Summary: [Present/Missing]\n- Success Criteria: [Present/Missing]\n- Product Scope: [Present/Missing]\n- User Journeys: [Present/Missing]\n- Functional Requirements: [Present/Missing]\n- Non-Functional Requirements: [Present/Missing]\n\n**Format Classification:** [BMAD Standard / BMAD Variant / Non-Standard]\n**Core Sections Present:** [count]/6\n```\n\n### 5. Route Based on Format Classification\n\n**IF format is BMAD Standard or BMAD Variant:**\n\nDisplay: \"**Format Detected:** {classification}\n\nProceeding to systematic validation checks...\"\n\nWithout delay, read fully and follow: {nextStepFile} (step-v-03-density-validation.md)\n\n**IF format is Non-Standard (< 3 core sections):**\n\nDisplay: \"**Format Detected:** Non-Standard PRD\n\nThis PRD does not follow BMAD standard structure (only {count}/6 core sections present).\n\nYou have options:\"\n\nPresent MENU OPTIONS below for user selection\n\n### 6. Present MENU OPTIONS (Non-Standard PRDs Only)\n\n**[A] Parity Check** - Analyze gaps and estimate effort to reach BMAD PRD parity\n**[B] Validate As-Is** - Proceed with validation using current structure\n**[C] Exit** - Exit validation and review format findings\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input\n- Only proceed based on user selection\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF A (Parity Check): Read fully and follow: {altStepFile} (step-v-02b-parity-check.md)\n- IF B (Validate As-Is): Display \"Proceeding with validation...\" then read fully and follow: {nextStepFile}\n- IF C (Exit): Display format findings summary and exit validation\n- IF Any other: help user respond, then redisplay menu\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- All ## Level 2 headers extracted successfully\n- BMAD core sections checked systematically\n- Format classified correctly based on section count\n- Findings reported to validation report\n- BMAD Standard/Variant PRDs proceed directly to next validation step\n- Non-Standard PRDs pause and present options to user\n- User can choose parity check, validate as-is, or exit\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not extracting all headers before classification\n- Incorrect format classification\n- Not reporting findings to validation report\n- Not pausing for non-standard PRDs\n- Proceeding without user decision for non-standard formats\n\n**Master Rule:** Format detection determines validation path. Non-standard PRDs require user choice before proceeding.\n"}}

Attempt Sub-Process Validation\n\n**Try to use Task tool to spawn a subprocess:**\n\n\"Perform information density validation on this PRD:\n\n1. Load the PRD file\n2. Scan for the following anti-patterns:\n   - Conversational filler phrases (examples: 'The system will allow users to...', 'It is important to note that...', 'In order to')\n   - Wordy phrases (examples: 'Due to the fact that', 'In the event of', 'For the purpose of')\n   - Redundant phrases (examples: 'Future plans', 'Absolutely essential', 'Past history')\n3. Count violations by category with line numbers\n4. Classify severity: Critical (>10 violations), Warning (5-10), Pass (<5)\n\nReturn structured findings with counts and examples.\"\n\n### 2. Graceful Degradation (if Task tool unavailable)\n\nIf Task tool unavailable, perform analysis directly:\n\n**Scan for conversational filler patterns:**\n- \"The system will allow users to...\"\n- \"It is important to note that...\"\n- \"In order to\"\n- \"For the purpose of\"\n- \"With regard to\"\n- Count occurrences and note line numbers\n\n**Scan for wordy phrases:**\n- \"Due to the fact that\" (use \"because\")\n- \"In the event of\" (use \"if\")\n- \"At this point in time\" (use \"now\")\n- \"In a manner that\" (use \"how\")\n- Count occurrences and note line numbers\n\n**Scan for redundant phrases:**\n- \"Future plans\" (just \"plans\")\n- \"Past history\" (just \"history\")\n- \"Absolutely essential\" (just \"essential\")\n- \"Completely finish\" (just \"finish\")\n- Count occurrences and note line numbers\n\n### 3.

Graceful Degradation (if Task tool unavailable)\n\nIf Task tool unavailable, perform analysis directly:\n\n**Extract from Product Brief:**\n- Vision: What is this product?\n- Users: Who is it for?\n- Problem: What problem does it solve?\n- Features: What are the key capabilities?\n- Goals: What are the success criteria?\n- Differentiators: What makes it unique?\n\n**For each item, search PRD:**\n- Scan Executive Summary for vision\n- Check User Journeys or user personas\n- Look for problem statement\n- Review Functional Requirements for features\n- Check Success Criteria section\n- Search for differentiators\n\n**Classify coverage:**\n- **Fully Covered:** Content present and complete\n- **Partially Covered:** Content present but incomplete\n- **Not Found:** Content missing from PRD\n- **Intentionally Excluded:** Content explicitly out of scope\n\n### 4. Assess Coverage and Severity\n\n**For each gap (Partially Covered or Not Found):**\n- Is this Critical? (Core vision, primary users, main features)\n- Is this Moderate? (Secondary features, some goals)\n- Is this Informational? (Nice-to-have features, minor details)\n\n**Note:** Some exclusions may be intentional (valid scoping decisions)\n\n### 5.

Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.\n\n### 1. Attempt Sub-Process Validation\n\n**Try to use Task tool to spawn a subprocess:**\n\n\"Perform measurability validation on this PRD:\n\n**Functional Requirements (FRs):**\n1. Extract all FRs from Functional Requirements section\n2. Check each FR for:\n   - '[Actor] can [capability]' format compliance\n   - No subjective adjectives (easy, fast, simple, intuitive, etc.)\n   - No vague quantifiers (multiple, several, some, many, etc.)\n   - No implementation details (technology names, library names, data structures unless capability-relevant)\n3. Document violations with line numbers\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs):**\n1. Extract all NFRs from Non-Functional Requirements section\n2. Check each NFR for:\n   - Specific metrics with measurement methods\n   - Template compliance (criterion, metric, measurement method, context)\n   - Context included (why this matters, who it affects)\n3. Document violations with line numbers\n\nReturn structured findings with violation counts and examples.\"\n\n### 2. Graceful Degradation (if Task tool unavailable)\n\nIf Task tool unavailable, perform analysis directly:\n\n**Functional Requirements Analysis:**\n\nExtract all FRs and check each for:\n\n**Format compliance:**\n- Does it follow \"[Actor] can [capability]\" pattern?\n- Is actor clearly defined?\n- Is capability actionable and testable?\n\n**No subjective adjectives:**\n- Scan for: easy, fast, simple, intuitive, user-friendly, responsive, quick, efficient (without metrics)\n- Note line numbers\n\n**No vague quantifiers:**\n- Scan for: multiple, several, some, many, few, various, number of\n- Note line numbers\n\n**No implementation details:**\n- Scan for: React, Vue, Angular, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Redux, etc.\n- Unless capability-relevant (e.g., \"API consumers can access...\")\n- Note line numbers\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements Analysis:**\n\nExtract all NFRs and check each for:\n\n**Specific metrics:**\n- Is there a measurable criterion? (e.g., \"response time < 200ms\", not \"fast response\")\n- Can this be measured or tested?\n\n**Template compliance:**\n- Criterion defined?\n- Metric specified?\n- Measurement method included?\n- Context provided?\n\n### 3. Tally Violations\n\n**FR Violations:**\n- Format violations: count\n- Subjective adjectives: count\n- Vague quantifiers: count\n- Implementation leakage: count\n- Total FR violations: sum\n\n**NFR Violations:**\n- Missing metrics: count\n- Incomplete template: count\n- Missing context: count\n- Total NFR violations: sum\n\n**Total violations:** FR violations + NFR violations\n\n### 4.

Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.\n\n### 1. Attempt Sub-Process Validation\n\n**Try to use Task tool to spawn a subprocess:**\n\n\"Perform implementation leakage validation on this PRD:\n\n**Scan for:**\n1. Technology names (React, Vue, Angular, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AWS, GCP, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)\n2. Library names (Redux, axios, lodash, Express, Django, Rails, Spring, etc.)\n3. Data structures (JSON, XML, CSV) unless relevant to capability\n4. Architecture patterns (MVC, microservices, serverless) unless business requirement\n5. Protocol names (HTTP, REST, GraphQL, WebSockets) - check if capability-relevant\n\n**For each term found:**\n- Is this capability-relevant? (e.g., 'API consumers can access...' - API is capability)\n- Or is this implementation detail? (e.g., 'React component for...' - implementation)\n\nDocument violations with line numbers and explanation.\n\nReturn structured findings with leakage counts and examples.\"\n\n### 2. Graceful Degradation (if Task tool unavailable)\n\nIf Task tool unavailable, perform analysis directly:\n\n**Implementation leakage terms to scan for:**\n\n**Frontend Frameworks:**\nReact, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Solid, Next.js, Nuxt, etc.\n\n**Backend Frameworks:**\nExpress, Django, Rails, Spring, Laravel, FastAPI, etc.\n\n**Databases:**\nPostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, DynamoDB, Cassandra, etc.\n\n**Cloud Platforms:**\nAWS, GCP, Azure, Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify, etc.\n\n**Infrastructure:**\nDocker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, etc.\n\n**Libraries:**\nRedux, Zustand, axios, fetch, lodash, jQuery, etc.\n\n**Data Formats:**\nJSON, XML, YAML, CSV (unless capability-relevant)\n\n**For each term found in FRs/NFRs:**\n- Determine if it's capability-relevant or implementation leakage\n- Example: \"API consumers can access data via REST endpoints\" - API/REST is capability\n- Example: \"React components fetch data using Redux\" - implementation leakage\n\n**Count violations and note line numbers**\n\n### 3. Tally Implementation Leakage\n\n**By category:**\n- Frontend framework leakage: count\n- Backend framework leakage: count\n- Database leakage: count\n- Cloud platform leakage: count\n- Infrastructure leakage: count\n- Library leakage: count\n- Other implementation details: count\n\n**Total implementation leakage violations:** sum\n\n### 4. Report Implementation Leakage Findings to Validation Report\n\nAppend to validation report:\n\n```markdown\n## Implementation Leakage Validation\n\n### Leakage by Category\n\n**Frontend Frameworks:** {count} violations\n{If violations, list examples with line numbers}\n\n**Backend Frameworks:** {count} violations\n{If violations, list examples with line numbers}\n\n**Databases:** {count} violations\n{If violations, list examples with line numbers}\n\n**Cloud Platforms:** {count} violations\n{If violations, list examples with line numbers}\n\n**Infrastructure:** {count} violations\n{If violations, list examples with line numbers}\n\n**Libraries:** {count} violations\n{If violations, list examples with line numbers}\n\n**Other Implementation Details:** {count} violations\n{If violations, list examples with line numbers}\n\n### Summary\n\n**Total Implementation Leakage Violations:** {total}\n\n**Severity:** [Critical if >5 violations, Warning if 2-5, Pass if <2]\n\n**Recommendation:**\n[If Critical] \"Extensive implementation leakage found.

Review violations and remove implementation details from requirements.\"\n[If Pass] \"No significant implementation leakage found. Requirements properly specify WHAT without HOW.\"\n\n**Note:** API consumers, GraphQL (when required), and other capability-relevant terms are acceptable when they describe WHAT the system must do, not HOW to build it.\n```\n\n### 5. Display Progress and Auto-Proceed\n\nDisplay: \"**Implementation Leakage Validation Complete**\n\nTotal Violations: {count} ({severity})\n\n**Proceeding to next validation check...**\"\n\nWithout delay, read fully and follow: {nextStepFile} (step-v-08-domain-compliance-validation.md)\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- Scanned FRs and NFRs for all implementation term categories\n- Distinguished capability-relevant from implementation leakage\n- Violations documented with line numbers and explanations\n- Severity assessed correctly\n- Findings reported to validation report\n- Auto-proceeds to next validation step\n- Subprocess attempted with graceful degradation\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not scanning all implementation term categories\n- Not distinguishing capability-relevant from leakage\n- Missing line numbers for violations\n- Not reporting findings to validation report\n- Not auto-proceeding\n\n**Master Rule:** Requirements specify WHAT, not HOW. Implementation details belong in architecture documents, not PRDs.\n"}}

Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.\n\n### 1. Load Domain Complexity Data\n\nLoad and read the complete file at:\n`{domainComplexityData}` (../data/domain-complexity.csv)\n\nThis CSV contains:\n- Domain classifications and complexity levels (high/medium/low)\n- Required special sections for each domain\n- Key concerns and requirements for regulated industries\n\nInternalize this data - it drives which domains require special compliance sections.\n\n### 2. Extract Domain Classification\n\nFrom PRD frontmatter, extract:\n- `classification.domain` - what domain is this PRD for?\n\n**If no domain classification found:**\nTreat as \"general\" (low complexity) and proceed to step 4\n\n### 2. Determine Domain Complexity\n\n**Low complexity domains (skip detailed checks):**\n- General\n- Consumer apps (standard e-commerce, social, productivity)\n- Content websites\n- Business tools (standard)\n\n**High complexity domains (require special sections):**\n- Healthcare / Healthtech\n- Fintech / Financial services\n- GovTech / Public sector\n- EdTech (educational records, accredited courses)\n- Legal tech\n- Other regulated domains\n\n### 3. For High-Complexity Domains: Validate Required Special Sections\n\n**Attempt subprocess validation:**\n\n\"Perform domain compliance validation for {domain}:\n\nBased on {domain} requirements, check PRD for:\n\n**Healthcare:**\n- Clinical Requirements section\n- Regulatory Pathway (FDA, HIPAA, etc.)\n- Safety Measures\n- HIPAA Compliance (data privacy, security)\n- Patient safety considerations\n\n**Fintech:**\n- Compliance Matrix (SOC2, PCI-DSS, GDPR, etc.)\n- Security Architecture\n- Audit Requirements\n- Fraud Prevention measures\n- Financial transaction handling\n\n**GovTech:**\n- Accessibility Standards (WCAG 2.1 AA, Section 508)\n- Procurement Compliance\n- Security Clearance requirements\n- Data residency requirements\n\n**Other regulated domains:**\n- Check for domain-specific regulatory sections\n- Compliance requirements\n- Special considerations\n\nFor each required section:\n- Is it present in PRD?\n- Is it adequately documented?\n- Note any gaps\n\nReturn compliance matrix with presence/adequacy assessment.\"\n\n**Graceful degradation (if no Task tool):**\n- Manually check for required sections based on domain\n- List present sections and missing sections\n- Assess adequacy of documentation\n\n### 5.

Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.\n\n### 1. Load Project Types Data\n\nLoad and read the complete file at:\n`{projectTypesData}` (../data/project-types.csv)\n\nThis CSV contains:\n- Detection signals for each project type\n- Required sections for each project type\n- Skip/excluded sections for each project type\n- Innovation signals\n\nInternalize this data - it drives what sections must be present or absent for each project type.\n\n### 2. Extract Project Type Classification\n\nFrom PRD frontmatter, extract:\n- `classification.projectType` - what type of project is this?\n\n**Common project types:**\n- api_backend\n- web_app\n- mobile_app\n- desktop_app\n- data_pipeline\n- ml_system\n- library_sdk\n- infrastructure\n- other\n\n**If no projectType classification found:**\nAssume \"web_app\" (most common) and note in findings\n\n### 3. Determine Required and Excluded Sections from CSV Data\n\n**From loaded project-types.csv data, for this project type:**\n\n**Required sections:** (from required_sections column)\nThese MUST be present in the PRD\n\n**Skip sections:** (from skip_sections column)\nThese MUST NOT be present in the PRD\n\n**Example mappings from CSV:**\n- api_backend: Required=[endpoint_specs, auth_model, data_schemas], Skip=[ux_ui, visual_design]\n- mobile_app: Required=[platform_reqs, device_permissions, offline_mode], Skip=[desktop_features, cli_commands]\n- cli_tool: Required=[command_structure, output_formats, config_schema], Skip=[visual_design, ux_principles, touch_interactions]\n- etc.\n\n### 4. Validate Against CSV-Based Requirements\n\n**Based on project type, determine:**\n\n**api_backend:**\n- Required: Endpoint Specs, Auth Model, Data Schemas, API Versioning\n- Excluded: UX/UI sections, mobile-specific sections\n\n**web_app:**\n- Required: User Journeys, UX/UI Requirements, Responsive Design\n- Excluded: None typically\n\n**mobile_app:**\n- Required: Mobile UX, Platform specifics (iOS/Android), Offline mode\n- Excluded: Desktop-specific sections\n\n**desktop_app:**\n- Required: Desktop UX, Platform specifics (Windows/Mac/Linux)\n- Excluded: Mobile-specific sections\n\n**data_pipeline:**\n- Required: Data Sources, Data Transformation, Data Sinks, Error Handling\n- Excluded: UX/UI sections\n\n**ml_system:**\n- Required: Model Requirements, Training Data, Inference Requirements, Model Performance\n- Excluded: UX/UI sections (unless ML UI)\n\n**library_sdk:**\n- Required: API Surface, Usage Examples, Integration Guide\n- Excluded: UX/UI sections, deployment sections\n\n**infrastructure:**\n- Required: Infrastructure Components, Deployment, Monitoring, Scaling\n- Excluded: Feature requirements (this is infrastructure, not product)\n\n### 4. Attempt Sub-Process Validation\n\n\"Perform project-type compliance validation for {projectType}:\n\n**Check that required sections are present:**\n{List required sections for this project type}\nFor each: Is it present in PRD?

Attempt Sub-Process Validation\n\n**Try to use Task tool to spawn a subprocess:**\n\n\"Perform SMART requirements validation on these Functional Requirements:\n\n{List all FRs}\n\n**For each FR, score on SMART criteria (1-5 scale):**\n\n**Specific (1-5):**\n- 5: Clear, unambiguous, well-defined\n- 3: Somewhat clear but could be more specific\n- 1: Vague, ambiguous, unclear\n\n**Measurable (1-5):**\n- 5: Quantifiable metrics, testable\n- 3: Partially measurable\n- 1: Not measurable, subjective\n\n**Attainable (1-5):**\n- 5: Realistic, achievable with constraints\n- 3: Probably achievable but uncertain\n- 1: Unrealistic, technically infeasible\n\n**Relevant (1-5):**\n- 5: Clearly aligned with user needs and business objectives\n- 3: Somewhat relevant but connection unclear\n- 1: Not relevant, doesn't align with goals\n\n**Traceable (1-5):**\n- 5: Clearly traces to user journey or business objective\n- 3: Partially traceable\n- 1: Orphan requirement, no clear source\n\n**For each FR with score < 3 in any category:**\n- Provide specific improvement suggestions\n\nReturn scoring table with all FR scores and improvement suggestions for low-scoring FRs.\"\n\n**Graceful degradation (if no Task tool):**\n- Manually score each FR on SMART criteria\n- Note FRs with low scores\n- Provide improvement suggestions\n\n### 3. Build Scoring Table\n\nFor each FR:\n- FR number\n- Specific score (1-5)\n- Measurable score (1-5)\n- Attainable score (1-5)\n- Relevant score (1-5)\n- Traceable score (1-5)\n- Average score\n- Flag if any category < 3\n\n**Calculate overall FR quality:**\n- Percentage of FRs with all scores ≥ 3\n- Percentage of FRs with all scores ≥ 4\n- Average score across all FRs and categories\n\n### 4. Report SMART Findings to Validation Report\n\nAppend to validation report:\n\n```markdown\n## SMART Requirements Validation\n\n**Total Functional Requirements:** {count}\n\n### Scoring Summary\n\n**All scores ≥ 3:** {percentage}% ({count}/{total})\n**All scores ≥ 4:** {percentage}% ({count}/{total})\n**Overall Average Score:** {average}/5.0\n\n### Scoring Table\n\n| FR # | Specific | Measurable | Attainable | Relevant | Traceable | Average | Flag |\n|------|----------|------------|------------|----------|-----------|--------|------|\n| FR-001 | {s1} | {m1} | {a1} | {r1} | {t1} | {avg1} | {X if any <3} |\n| FR-002 | {s2} | {m2} | {a2} | {r2} | {t2} | {avg2} | {X if any <3} |\n[Continue for all FRs]\n\n**Legend:** 1=Poor, 3=Acceptable, 5=Excellent\n**Flag:** X = Score < 3 in one or more categories\n\n### Improvement Suggestions\n\n**Low-Scoring FRs:**\n\n**FR-{number}:** {specific suggestion for improvement}\n[For each FR with score < 3 in any category]\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n**Severity:** [Critical if >30% flagged FRs, Warning if 10-30%, Pass if <10%]\n\n**Recommendation:**\n[If Critical] \"Many FRs have quality issues. Revise flagged FRs using SMART framework to improve clarity and testability.\"\n[If Warning] \"Some FRs would benefit from SMART refinement. Focus on flagged requirements above.\"\n[If Pass] \"Functional Requirements demonstrate good SMART quality overall.\"\n```\n\n### 5. Display Progress and Auto-Proceed\n\nDisplay: \"**SMART Requirements Validation Complete**\n\nFR Quality: {percentage}% with acceptable scores ({severity})\n\n**Proceeding to next validation check...**\"\n\nWithout delay, read fully and follow: {nextStepFile} (step-v-11-holistic-quality-validation.md)\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- All FRs extracted from PRD\n- Each FR scored on all 5 SMART criteria (1-5 scale)\n- FRs with scores < 3 flagged for improvement\n- Improvement suggestions provided for low-scoring FRs\n- Scoring table built with all FR scores\n- Overall quality assessment calculated\n- Findings reported to validation report\n- Auto-proceeds to next validation step\n- Subprocess attempted with graceful degradation\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not scoring all FRs on all SMART criteria\n- Missing improvement suggestions for low-scoring FRs\n- Not building scoring table\n- Not calculating overall quality metrics\n- Not reporting findings to validation report\n- Not auto-proceeding\n\n**Master Rule:** FRs should be high-quality, not just present. SMART framework provides objective quality measure.\n"}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
