You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"},"git":{}}}

Check for Existing Workflow\n\nFirst, check if the output document already exists:\n\n- Look for file at `{planning_artifacts}/*ux-design-specification*.md`\n- If exists, read the complete file including frontmatter\n- If not exists, this is a fresh workflow\n\n### 2. Handle Continuation (If Document Exists)\n\nIf the document exists and has frontmatter with `stepsCompleted`:\n\n- **STOP here** and load `./step-01b-continue.md` immediately\n- Do not proceed with any initialization tasks\n- Let step-01b handle the continuation logic\n\n### 3. Fresh Workflow Setup (If No Document)\n\nIf no document exists or no `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter:\n\n#### A. Input Document Discovery\n\nDiscover and load context documents using smart discovery. Documents can be in the following locations:\n- {planning_artifacts}/**\n- {output_folder}/**\n- {product_knowledge}/**\n- docs/**\n\nAlso - when searching - documents can be a single markdown file, or a folder with an index and multiple files. For Example, if searching for `*foo*.md` and not found, also search for a folder called *foo*/index.md (which indicates sharded content)\n\nTry to discover the following:\n- Product Brief (`*brief*.md`)\n- Research Documents (`*prd*.md`)\n- Project Documentation (generally multiple documents might be found for this in the `{product_knowledge}` or `docs` folder.)\n- Project Context (`**/project-context.md`)\n\n<critical>Confirm what you have found with the user, along with asking if the user wants to provide anything else. Only after this confirmation will you proceed to follow the loading rules</critical>\n\n**Loading Rules:**\n\n- Load ALL discovered files completely that the user confirmed or provided (no offset/limit)\n- If there is a project context, whatever is relevant should try to be biased in the remainder of this whole workflow process\n- For sharded folders, load ALL files to get complete picture, using the index first to potentially know the potential of each document\n- index.md is a guide to what's relevant whenever available\n- Track all successfully loaded files in frontmatter `inputDocuments` array\n\n#### B. Create Initial Document\n\nCopy the template from `{installed_path}/ux-design-template.md` to `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-specification.md`\nInitialize frontmatter in the template.\n\n#### C. Complete Initialization and Report\n\nComplete setup and report to user:\n\n**Document Setup:**\n\n- Created: `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-specification.md` from template\n- Initialized frontmatter with workflow state\n\n**Input Documents Discovered:**\nReport what was found:\n\"Welcome {{user_name}}! I've set up your UX design workspace for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Documents Found:**\n\n- PRD: {number of PRD files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Product brief: {number of brief files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Other context: {number of other files loaded or \"None found\"}\n\n**Files loaded:** {list of specific file names or \"No additional documents found\"}\n\nDo you have any other documents you'd like me to include, or shall we continue to the next step?\n\n[C] Continue to UX discovery\"\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects [C] to continue, ensure the file `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-specification.md` has been created and saved, and then load `./step-02-discovery.md` to begin the UX discovery phase.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-02 until output file has been updated and user explicitly selects [C] to continue!\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Existing workflow detected and handed off to step-01b correctly\n✅ Fresh workflow initialized with template and frontmatter\n✅ Input documents discovered and loaded using sharded-first logic\n✅ All discovered files tracked in frontmatter `inputDocuments`\n✅ User confirmed document setup and can proceed\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Proceeding with fresh initialization when existing workflow exists\n❌ Not updating frontmatter with discovered input documents\n❌ Creating document without proper template\n❌ Not checking sharded folders first before whole files\n❌ Not reporting what documents were found to user\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n"}}

The focus is on increasing process quality and reliability, reducing cognitive load, and improving reporting consistency, while keeping the existing toolset (Jira, Squash, Excel, PPT, Outlook, Teams, SharePoint).\n\n2) Why This Matters\nCurrent workflows rely on manual data transfers between tools, variable ticket quality, and high reporting effort. These factors reduce reliability and create unnecessary risk for test outcomes and stakeholder visibility. A more standardized and traceable process improves confidence, clarity, and decision-making.\n\n3) Objectives\nPrimary\n- Improve quality and reliability of preparation and reporting processes.\n- Standardize the way test inputs and outputs are handled.\n\nSecondary\n- Reduce mental load and repetitive manual work.\n- Improve traceability of tests, evidence, and anomalies.\n\n4) Scope (Phase 1)\nIn scope\n- Ticket readiness and testability qualification\n- Estimation and strategy validation\n- Standardized anomaly reporting\n- Daily and weekly reporting consistency\n\nOut of scope (Phase 1)\n- Full automation of test execution\n- Tool replacement or migration\n- Contractual process changes\n\n5) Key Challenges Observed\n- Ticket descriptions often lack clear acceptance criteria\n- Reporting requires manual copying and reformatting from multiple tools\n- Anomaly descriptions are inconsistent in format and detail\n- Reporting effort is high and varies by workload\n\n6) Expected Benefits\n- More reliable test planning and execution\n- Faster and more consistent reporting\n- Clearer anomaly documentation for analysis and fix cycles\n- Reduced risk of errors due to manual data transfer\n\n7) Proposed Direction (High-Level)\n- Introduce a testability checklist to ensure ticket readiness\n- Formalize validation of test strategy before design\n- Define a single source of truth for reporting metrics\n- Auto-populate daily and weekly reports where possible\n- Standardize anomaly templates and evidence linking\n\n8) Success Indicators\n- Higher % of tickets passing readiness checks before estimation\n- Reduced manual data entry points per report\n- Improved consistency of anomaly reports\n- Lower reporting error rate and improved timeliness\n\n9) Open Questions\n- Availability of API/export access for Jira and Squash\n- Acceptance of automated or scripted reporting support\n- Ownership for template and standard approvals\n\n10) Next Steps\n- Confirm constraints and access (APIs, exports, macros)\n- Agree on checklist, templates, and validation flow\n- Pilot on 1–2 perimeters before wider rollout\n"}}

The current process suffers from ambiguous ticket inputs, manual data transposition across tools, and inconsistent reporting standards. The target outcome is a reliable, standardized, traceable process that reduces cognitive load and improves output consistency, without changing the toolset.\n\n2) Background & Problem\nThe tester must manage multiple perimeters, perform estimation, create detailed test designs, execute tests, document evidence, and produce daily/weekly reports. Inputs (Jira tickets) often lack explicit acceptance criteria and require significant clarification. Reporting involves heavy manual extraction and re-entry into Excel and PPT, which causes errors and inconsistent outputs.\n\n3) Goals & Success Criteria\nPrimary Goals\n- Increase quality and reliability of test preparation and reporting.\n- Standardize inputs and outputs to reduce variability.\n\nSecondary Goals\n- Reduce cognitive load and manual effort.\n- Improve traceability across tests, evidence, anomalies, and reporting.\n\nSuccess Criteria (KPIs)\n- % tickets passing testability checklist before estimation\n- Reduction in manual data entry points per report\n- Template compliance rate for anomalies\n- Reporting error rate (mismatch/outdated metrics)\n- Reporting time per week (secondary KPI)\n\n4) Scope\nIn Scope (Priority)\nA) Preparation / Scoping\n- Testability qualification\n- Estimation standardization\n- Strategy validation\n- Reuse of existing test assets\n- Planning aligned with QA/HO cadence\n\nC) Reporting / CR\n- Weekly PPT reporting (fixed slide structure)\n- Daily CR reporting per perimeter\n- Final test/recipe reports + Jira comments\n\nOut of Scope (Phase 1)\n- Test execution automation\n- Tool replacement or migration\n- Contractual changes to client processes\n\n5) Users & Stakeholders\n- Primary User: QA Tester (TRA)\n- Stakeholders: CP (Project Manager), MOA, QA Lead / Pilot\n\n6) Current Workflow Summary\nPreparation / Scoping\n- Receive Jira tickets; estimate complexity and effort\n- Create estimates in Excel; align strategy with CP/MOA\n- Review Squash for reusable test cases\n- Align with QA and HO release cadence\n\nReporting\n- Weekly PPT: fixed slides with metrics, anomalies, priorities\n- Daily CR: Excel tables pasted into email\n- Recipe reports + Jira comment summarizing campaigns and evidence\n\n7) Pain Points\n- Ambiguous ticket inputs -> unreliable test design\n- Manual transposition across tools -> errors, inconsistencies\n- Lack of standardized anomaly template\n- Reporting burden -> cognitive overload\n- Environment availability disrupts flow\n\n8) Requirements\nFunctional Requirements\nFR1 - Testability Checklist & Score\nProvide a short checklist and numeric score for ticket readiness.\nOutput: Go / Clarify / No-Go.\n\nFR2 - Formal Strategy Validation\nIntroduce a visible approval step (CP/MOA) before design.\n\nFR3 - Single Source of Truth\nEach metric used in reports must derive from one authoritative source.\n\nFR4 - Automated Report Population\nDaily/weekly CR blocks are auto-filled from Jira/Squash/Excel.\n\nFR5 - Standardized Anomaly Template\nMandatory fields for clarity (context, repro, evidence, impact).\n\nFR6 - Evidence Traceability\nConsistent evidence naming + links in reports and tickets.\n\nFR7 - Calendar-Aware Planning\nHighlight risk against QA and HO cadence.\n\nFR8 - Test Asset Reuse Discovery\nAutomatically surface relevant test cases in Squash.\n\nNon-Functional Requirements\n- Must work with existing tools (Jira, Squash, Excel, PPT, Outlook, Teams, SharePoint)\n- Must respect fixed weekly PPT slide structure\n- Daily CR must hide empty sections\n- Minimal change management load for stakeholders\n\n9) User Stories (High-Level)\n1. As a tester, I want a testability checklist so I can decide whether a ticket is ready.\n2. As a tester, I want formal strategy validation to avoid testing unclear scope.\n3. As a tester, I want reports to auto-fill so I avoid manual retyping.\n4. As a CP, I want consistent weekly reports so I can trust the data.\n5. As a MOA, I want standardized anomaly reports for faster analysis.\n\n10) Constraints & Dependencies\n- Weekly report slide structure is fixed; only hidden if irrelevant.\n- Daily CR must exclude empty blocks.\n- API/export access to Jira/Squash may be required.\n- Stakeholder validation workflows must be accepted.\n\n11) Risks\n- Limited API access could reduce automation potential.\n- Change resistance to new templates or validation gates.\n- Over-engineering might increase workload if not streamlined.\n\n12) Open Questions\n- Are Jira/Squash APIs accessible, or only exports?\n- What KPI thresholds matter most to CP/MOA?\n- Are macros/scripts acceptable in the client environment?\n- Who approves new templates/standards?\n\n13) Milestones (Suggested)\nPhase 1 - Standardization (Quick Wins)\n- Testability checklist + anomaly template\n- Reporting source of truth definition\n\nPhase 2 - Automation\n- Auto-fill daily CR\n- PPT report data injection\n\nPhase 3 - Optimization\n- Asset reuse discovery\n- KPI dashboards and quality gates\n\n14) Requirements Prioritization\nP0 - Must Have (critical for quality and reliability)\n- FR1 - Testability Checklist & Score\n- FR2 - Formal Strategy Validation\n- FR3 - Single Source of Truth\n- FR5 - Standardized Anomaly Template\n- FR6 - Evidence Traceability\n\nP1 - Should Have (strong impact, but not blocking)\n- FR4 - Automated Report Population\n- FR7 - Calendar-Aware Planning\n- FR8 - Test Asset Reuse Discovery\n\nP2 - Nice to Have (optimization / future)\n- KPI dashboards beyond core KPIs\n- Advanced automation or AI-assisted ticket analysis\n- Cross-perimeter predictive planning\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Les emails sont tries rapidement, puis le weekly TRA aligne les priorites. Le planning mensuel te donne une trajectoire claire.\nEn phase devis, les tickets Jira passent par une checklist testabilite : ceux qui ne sont pas \"ready\" sont immediatement identifies. Un pipeline d'aide propose une extraction d'exigences et une strategie de tests structuree, que tu ajustes.\nEn conception, Squash est alimente par des propositions de cas de test pretes a relire, avec la checklist ESN integree.\nEn execution, tu lances la campagne ; les preuves video sont centralisees automatiquement et liees aux cas. Les anomalies se generent avec un template structure, preuves liees, et l'association Squash <-> Jira est fluide.\nEn fin de journee, le CR quotidien est pre-rempli (extraction Jira/Squash/Outlook), tu corriges et envoies en 5 minutes.\nLe mercredi, le PPT hebdo est pre-genere a partir des sources, tu ajustes les priorites et l'envoies.\nResultat : un rythme maitrise, une qualite percue superieure, et un effort mental reduit.\n\n### Journey 2 - Primary User - Edge Case \"jour qui deborde\"\nLe weekly deborde, les tickets sont volumineux et mal cadres. Tu risques la dispersion.\nLe systeme te ramene a un cadre industriel : tri automatique des tickets, alertes sur manque d'infos, actions proposees (clarification, demande MOA, report).\nIl suit la consommation de charge vs prevision, t'alerte avant la derive, et propose un plan de rattrapage (priorite, suspension, decalage).\nEn fin de journee, meme si tout part en vrille, le CR pre-rempli securise le rituel, evite le \"non-envoi\".\nResultat : tu gardes le controle, meme dans le chaos.\n\n### Journey 3 - Admin/Ops (toi) - Configuration et gouvernance\nTu ajustes les templates (anomalies, CR, PPT), les regles de checklist, les seuils KPI, et les sources de verite.\nTu ajoutes un nouveau perimetre, tu declares ses regles de nommage, et tu reutilises le pipeline existant.\nResultat : l'outillage est modulaire, maintenable, reutilisable.\n\n### Journey 4 - Support/Qualite - Investigation d'erreurs\nUne extraction ne colle pas. Tu consultes les logs de pipeline (quelle source, quelle transformation, quel mapping) et tu corriges.\nTu peux rejouer une extraction en mode diagnostic.\nResultat : transparence, fiabilite, et reduction des erreurs silencieuses.\n\n### Journey 5 - Reutilisation/Integration - Un autre projet branche la logique\nUn futur testeur clone le workflow, charge ses propres sources (Jira/Squash) et ses templates.\nLes modules sont interchangeables (reporting, checklist, anomalies, generation).\nResultat : transfert rapide, industrialisation multi-projets.\n\n### Journey 6 - TNR - Phase critique GO/NO-GO\nEn fin de lot, la campagne TNR est copiee et structuree automatiquement.\nLes anomalies TNR sont taguees, les preuves sont centralisees, et le PPT TNR est pre-rempli (GO/NO-GO, reserves, liens).\nResultat : decision finale plus fiable, moins de stress.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n- Pipeline d'extraction Jira/Squash/Outlook/Excel/PPT -> pre-remplissage CR et PPT\n- Checklist testabilite + scoring Go / Clarify / No-Go\n- Generation de brouillons (cas de tests, anomalies) avec LLM local\n- Tracabilite complete preuves <-> cas <-> anomalies <-> tickets\n- Modules reutilisables + configuration par projet\n- Logs/diagnostics et mode replay\n- Gestion charge vs prevision + alertes\n- Support TNR (campagne, tags, reporting GO/NO-GO)\n\n## Domain-Specific Requirements\n\n### Compliance & Regulatory\n- Usage IA sensible : LLM local prioritaire, cloud possible mais jamais sans anonymisation automatique.\n- Mecanisme d'anonymisation by design avant tout envoi vers un LLM cloud.\n- Aucune donnee sensible (clients finaux) ne doit sortir du perimetre sans masquage.\n\n### Regulatory Requirements (Assurance)\n- Conformite aux exigences assurance par juridiction (a confirmer avec le client).\n- Respect des politiques internes de conservation des preuves et livrables (duree, lieu, acces).\n- Journalisation minimale pour audit interne (qui, quand, quoi) sans donnees sensibles.\n\n### Risk Modeling (Assurance)\n- Hors scope du MVP : aucune decision actuarielle ni modele de risque automatique.\n- Si des indicateurs de risque sont ajoutes plus tard, ils doivent etre explicitement valides par le client.\n\n### Fraud Detection\n- Hors scope du MVP : aucune detection de fraude automatique.\n- Possibilite future de signaler des anomalies suspectes via tags standardises (sans decision automatique).\n\n### Reporting Compliance\n- Conformite aux formats de reporting attendus par le client (PPT, CR, TNR).\n- Traçabilite des rapports via stockage SharePoint et references Jira/Squash.\n\n### Technical Constraints\n- Jira : API token OK (hors VM).\n- Squash : Basic auth au depart (token a demander).\n- Least privilege : demarrage read-only, ecriture apres validation.\n- Secrets dans un coffre/secret store, jamais en clair.\n- HTTPS/TLS pour API ; Squash en HTTP probable (a faire evoluer).\n- Stockage au repos sur SharePoint ; donnees locales minimisees, chiffrees, purges.\n- Audit logs minimaux : horodatage, perimetre, version, statut, sans donnees sensibles.\n- Restrictions IT a confirmer : scripts signes/macros, droits install, proxy, appels externes.\n- Execution idealement sur environnement approuve (poste + M365), VM reservee aux applis testees.\n\n### Integration Requirements\n- Critiques : Jira + Squash (sources de verite), SharePoint (preuves/livrables), Excel & PowerPoint (CR + reporting).\n- Souhaitees : Outlook + Teams pour diffusion et recuperation d'infos reunions.\n- Jira : API OK, tokens OK.\n- Squash : API OK en Basic, token non dispo immediatement.\n\n### Risk Mitigations\n- Squash token manquant : demarrage en Basic, plan d'evolution.\n- Outlook/Teams API possiblement restreints : risque sur automatisation diffusion.\n- Cloud LLM : risque privacy -> anonymisation automatique + option LLM local.\n\n## Innovation & Novel Patterns\n\n### Detected Innovation Areas\n- Exploitation des preuves video pour detecter des ecarts avec les cas de test et proposer des ameliorations de redaction (priorite d'innovation).\n- LLM local integre au workflow : CLI conversationnel + etapes automatiques dans le pipeline selon le contexte.\n- Pipeline d'industrialisation reutilisable multi-projets (modules interchangeables).\n\n### Market Context & Competitive Landscape\n- Innovation interne : peu d'outillage TRA combine Jira/Squash/SharePoint et IA locale de maniere integree.\n- Differenciation via l'usage des preuves video pour ameliorer la qualite des cas de test.\n\n### Validation Approach\n- Prouver la valeur sur un lot pilote : reduction des erreurs de reporting et gain de temps sans perte de qualite.\n- Valider l'assistant LLM local sur un sous-ensemble de tickets et cas de test, avec relecture humaine obligatoire.\n- Valider la detection d'ecarts via preuves video sur un echantillon limite avant generalisation.\n\n### Risk Mitigation\n- Si l'IA video est trop complexe : fallback sur pipeline d'amelioration manuelle assistee.\n- Si l'IA locale est insuffisante : option cloud avec anonymisation automatique.\n- Si resistance au changement : activer en mode opt-in et comparer performances avant/apres.\n\n## CLI Tool Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n- Outil CLI interactif et scriptable, destine a industrialiser les flux QA (reporting, checklist, generation de brouillons).\n- Usage multi-projets avec profils et configuration reutilisable.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n- Modes d'execution : assistant interactif + batch/script.\n- Sorties multi-formats : texte, JSON, CSV, Markdown, HTML, YAML.\n- Separation stricte des secrets via secret store / env vars.\n\n### Command Structure\n- Commandes principales

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Review Loaded Context\n\nStart by analyzing what we know from the loaded documents:\n\"Based on the project documentation we have loaded, let me confirm what I'm understanding about {{project_name}}.\n\n**From the documents:**\n{summary of key insights from loaded PRD, briefs, and other context documents}\n\n**Target Users:**\n{summary of user information from loaded documents}\n\n**Key Features/Goals:**\n{summary of main features and goals from loaded documents}\n\nDoes this match your understanding? Are there any corrections or additions you'd like to make?\"\n\n### 2. Fill Context Gaps (If no documents or gaps exist)\n\nIf no documents were loaded or key information is missing:\n\"Since we don't have complete documentation, let's start with the essentials:\n\n**What are you building?** (Describe your product in 1-2 sentences)\n\n**Who is this for?** (Describe your ideal user or target audience)\n\n**What makes this special or different?** (What's the unique value proposition?)\n\n**What's the main thing users will do with this?** (Core user action or goal)\"\n\n### 3. Explore User Context Deeper\n\nDive into user understanding:\n\"Let me understand your users better to inform the UX design:\n\n**User Context Questions:**\n\n- What problem are users trying to solve?\n- What frustrates them with current solutions?\n- What would make them say 'this is exactly what I needed'?\n- How tech-savvy are your target users?\n- What devices will they use most?\n- When/where will they use this product?\"\n\n### 4. Identify UX Design Challenges\n\nSurface the key UX challenges to address:\n\"From what we've discussed, I'm seeing some key UX design considerations:\n\n**Design Challenges:**\n\n- [Identify 2-3 key UX challenges based on project type and user needs]\n- [Note any platform-specific considerations]\n- [Highlight any complex user flows or interactions]\n\n**Design Opportunities:**\n\n- [Identify 2-3 areas where great UX could create competitive advantage]\n- [Note any opportunities for innovative UX patterns]\n\nDoes this capture the key UX considerations we need to address?\"\n\n### 5. Generate Project Understanding Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Executive Summary\n\n### Project Vision\n\n[Project vision summary based on conversation]\n\n### Target Users\n\n[Target user descriptions based on conversation]\n\n### Key Design Challenges\n\n[Key UX challenges identified based on conversation]\n\n### Design Opportunities\n\n[Design opportunities identified based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 6.

Define Core User Action\n\nStart by identifying the most important user interaction:\n\"Now let's dig into the heart of the user experience for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Core Experience Questions:**\n\n- What's the ONE thing users will do most frequently?\n- What user action is absolutely critical to get right?\n- What should be completely effortless for users?\n- If we nail one interaction, everything else follows - what is it?\n\nThink about the core loop or primary action that defines your product's value.\"\n\n### 2. Explore Platform Requirements\n\nDetermine where and how users will interact:\n\"Let's define the platform context for {{project_name}}:\n\n**Platform Questions:**\n\n- Web, mobile app, desktop, or multiple platforms?\n- Will this be primarily touch-based or mouse/keyboard?\n- Any specific platform requirements or constraints?\n- Do we need to consider offline functionality?\n- Any device-specific capabilities we should leverage?\"\n\n### 3. Identify Effortless Interactions\n\nSurface what should feel magical or completely seamless:\n\"**Effortless Experience Design:**\n\n- What user actions should feel completely natural and require zero thought?\n- Where do users currently struggle with similar products?\n- What interaction, if made effortless, would create delight?\n- What should happen automatically without user intervention?\n- Where can we eliminate steps that competitors require?\"\n\n### 4. Define Critical Success Moments\n\nIdentify the moments that determine success or failure:\n\"**Critical Success Moments:**\n\n- What's the moment where users realize 'this is better'?\n- When does the user feel successful or accomplished?\n- What interaction, if failed, would ruin the experience?\n- What are the make-or-break user flows?\n- Where does first-time user success happen?\"\n\n### 5. Synthesize Experience Principles\n\nExtract guiding principles from the conversation:\n\"Based on our discussion, I'm hearing these core experience principles for {{project_name}}:\n\n**Experience Principles:**\n\n- [Principle 1 based on core action focus]\n- [Principle 2 based on effortless interactions]\n- [Principle 3 based on platform considerations]\n- [Principle 4 based on critical success moments]\n\nThese principles will guide all our UX decisions. Do these capture what's most important?\"\n\n### 6. Generate Core Experience Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Core User Experience\n\n### Defining Experience\n\n[Core experience definition based on conversation]\n\n### Platform Strategy\n\n[Platform requirements and decisions based on conversation]\n\n### Effortless Interactions\n\n[Effortless interaction areas identified based on conversation]\n\n### Critical Success Moments\n\n[Critical success moments defined based on conversation]\n\n### Experience Principles\n\n[Guiding principles for UX decisions based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated core experience content and present choices:\n\"I've defined the core user experience for {{project_name}} based on our conversation. This establishes the foundation for all our UX design decisions.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine the core experience definition\n[P] Party Mode - Bring different perspectives on the user experience\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to emotional response definition\"\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml with the current core experience content\n- Process the enhanced experience insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the core experience definition? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current core experience definition\n- Process the collaborative experience improvements that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the core experience definition? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: append step to end of stepsCompleted array\n- Load `./step-04-emotional-response.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Core user action clearly identified and defined\n✅ Platform requirements thoroughly explored\n✅ Effortless interaction areas identified\n✅ Critical success moments mapped out\n✅ Experience principles established as guiding framework\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Missing the core user action that defines the product\n❌ Not properly considering platform requirements\n❌ Overlooking what should be effortless for users\n❌ Not identifying critical make-or-break interactions\n❌ Experience principles too generic or not actionable\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-04-emotional-response.md` to define desired emotional responses.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-04 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Identify Emotional Journey Mapping\n\nExplore feelings at different stages:\n\"**Emotional Journey Considerations:**\n\n- How should users feel when they first discover the product?\n- What emotion during the core experience/action?\n- How should they feel after completing their task?\n- What if something goes wrong - what emotional response do we want?\n- How should they feel when returning to use it again?\"\n\n### 3. Define Micro-Emotions\n\nSurface subtle but important emotional states:\n\"**Micro-Emotions to Consider:**\n\n- Confidence vs. Confusion\n- Trust vs. Skepticism\n- Excitement vs. Anxiety\n- Accomplishment vs. Frustration\n- Delight vs. Satisfaction\n- Belonging vs. Isolation\n\nWhich of these emotional states are most critical for your product's success?\"\n\n### 4. Connect Emotions to UX Decisions\n\nLink feelings to design implications:\n\"**Design Implications:**\n\n- If we want users to feel [emotional state], what UX choices support this?\n- What interactions might create negative emotions we want to avoid?\n- Where can we add moments of delight or surprise?\n- How do we build trust and confidence through design?\n\n**Emotion-Design Connections:**\n\n- [Emotion 1] → [UX design approach]\n- [Emotion 2] → [UX design approach]\n- [Emotion 3] → [UX design approach]\"\n\n### 5. Validate Emotional Goals\n\nCheck if emotional goals align with product vision:\n\"Let me make sure I understand the emotional vision for {{project_name}}:\n\n**Primary Emotional Goal:** [Summarize main emotional response]\n**Secondary Feelings:** [List supporting emotional states]\n**Emotions to Avoid:** [List negative emotions to prevent]\n\nDoes this capture the emotional experience you want to create? Any adjustments needed?\"\n\n### 6. Generate Emotional Response Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Desired Emotional Response\n\n### Primary Emotional Goals\n\n[Primary emotional goals based on conversation]\n\n### Emotional Journey Mapping\n\n[Emotional journey mapping based on conversation]\n\n### Micro-Emotions\n\n[Micro-emotions identified based on conversation]\n\n### Design Implications\n\n[UX design implications for emotional responses based on conversation]\n\n### Emotional Design Principles\n\n[Guiding principles for emotional design based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated emotional response content and present choices:\n\"I've defined the desired emotional responses for {{project_name}}. These emotional goals will guide our design decisions to create the right user experience.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine the emotional response definition\n[P] Party Mode - Bring different perspectives on user emotional needs\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to inspiration analysis\"\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml with the current emotional response content\n- Process the enhanced emotional insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the emotional response definition? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current emotional response definition\n- Process the collaborative emotional insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the emotional response definition? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: append step to end of stepsCompleted array\n- Load `./step-05-inspiration.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Primary emotional goals clearly defined\n✅ Emotional journey mapped across user experience\n✅ Micro-emotions identified and addressed\n✅ Design implications connected to emotional responses\n✅ Emotional design principles established\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Missing core emotional goals or being too generic\n❌ Not considering emotional journey across different stages\n❌ Overlooking micro-emotions that impact user satisfaction\n❌ Not connecting emotional goals to specific UX design choices\n❌ Emotional principles too vague or not actionable\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-05-inspiration.md` to analyze UX patterns from inspiring products.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-05 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Identify User's Favorite Apps\n\nStart by gathering inspiration sources:\n\"Let's learn from products your users already love and use regularly.\n\n**Inspiration Questions:**\n\n- Name 2-3 apps your target users already love and USE frequently\n- For each one, what do they do well from a UX perspective?\n- What makes the experience compelling or delightful?\n- What keeps users coming back to these apps?\n\nThink about apps in your category or even unrelated products that have great UX.\"\n\n### 2. Analyze UX Patterns and Principles\n\nBreak down what makes these apps successful:\n\"For each inspiring app, let's analyze their UX success:\n\n**For [App Name]:**\n\n- What core problem does it solve elegantly?\n- What makes the onboarding experience effective?\n- How do they handle navigation and information hierarchy?\n- What are their most innovative or delightful interactions?\n- What visual design choices support the user experience?\n- How do they handle errors or edge cases?\"\n\n### 3. Extract Transferable Patterns\n\nIdentify patterns that could apply to your project:\n\"**Transferable UX Patterns:**\nLooking across these inspiring apps, I see patterns we could adapt:\n\n**Navigation Patterns:**\n\n- [Pattern 1] - could work for your [specific use case]\n- [Pattern 2] - might solve your [specific challenge]\n\n**Interaction Patterns:**\n\n- [Pattern 1] - excellent for [your user goal]\n- [Pattern 2] - addresses [your user pain point]\n\n**Visual Patterns:**\n\n- [Pattern 1] - supports your [emotional goal]\n- [Pattern 2] - aligns with your [platform requirements]\n\nWhich of these patterns resonate most for your product?\"\n\n### 4. Identify Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\nSurface what not to do based on analysis:\n\"**UX Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**\nFrom analyzing both successes and failures in your space, here are patterns to avoid:\n\n- [Anti-pattern 1] - users find this confusing/frustrating\n- [Anti-pattern 2] - this creates unnecessary friction\n- [Anti-pattern 3] - doesn't align with your [emotional goals]\n\nLearning from others' mistakes is as important as learning from their successes.\"\n\n### 5. Define Design Inspiration Strategy\n\nCreate a clear strategy for using this inspiration:\n\"**Design Inspiration Strategy:**\n\n**What to Adopt:**\n\n- [Specific pattern] - because it supports [your core experience]\n- [Specific pattern] - because it aligns with [user needs]\n\n**What to Adapt:**\n\n- [Specific pattern] - modify for [your unique requirements]\n- [Specific pattern] - simplify for [your user skill level]\n\n**What to Avoid:**\n\n- [Specific anti-pattern] - conflicts with [your goals]\n- [Specific anti-pattern] - doesn't fit [your platform]\n\nThis strategy will guide our design decisions while keeping {{project_name}} unique.\"\n\n### 6. Generate Inspiration Analysis Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration\n\n### Inspiring Products Analysis\n\n[Analysis of inspiring products based on conversation]\n\n### Transferable UX Patterns\n\n[Transferable patterns identified based on conversation]\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n[Anti-patterns to avoid based on conversation]\n\n### Design Inspiration Strategy\n\n[Strategy for using inspiration based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated inspiration analysis content and present choices:\n\"I've analyzed inspiring UX patterns and products to inform our design strategy for {{project_name}}. This gives us a solid foundation of proven patterns to build upon.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's deepen our UX pattern analysis\n[P] Party Mode - Bring different perspectives on inspiration sources\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to design system choice\"\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml with the current inspiration analysis content\n- Process the enhanced pattern insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the inspiration analysis? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current inspiration analysis\n- Process the collaborative pattern insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the inspiration analysis? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: append step to end of stepsCompleted array\n- Read fully and follow: `./step-06-design-system.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Inspiring products identified and analyzed thoroughly\n✅ UX patterns extracted and categorized effectively\n✅ Transferable patterns identified for current project\n✅ Anti-patterns identified to avoid common mistakes\n✅ Clear design inspiration strategy established\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not getting specific examples of inspiring products\n❌ Surface-level analysis without deep pattern extraction\n❌ Missing opportunities for pattern adaptation\n❌ Not identifying relevant anti-patterns to avoid\n❌ Strategy too generic or not actionable\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-06-design-system.md` to choose the appropriate design system approach.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-06 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Present Design System Options\n\nEducate about design system approaches:\n\"For {{project_name}}, we need to choose a design system foundation. Think of design systems like LEGO blocks for UI - they provide proven components and patterns, ensuring consistency and speeding development.\n\n**Design System Approaches:**\n\n**1. Custom Design System**\n\n- Complete visual uniqueness\n- Full control over every component\n- Higher initial investment\n- Perfect for established brands with unique needs\n\n**2. Established System (Material Design, Ant Design, etc.)**\n\n- Fast development with proven patterns\n- Great defaults and accessibility built-in\n- Less visual differentiation\n- Ideal for startups or internal tools\n\n**3. Themeable System (MUI, Chakra UI, Tailwind UI)**\n\n- Customizable with strong foundation\n- Brand flexibility with proven components\n- Moderate learning curve\n- Good balance of speed and uniqueness\n\nWhich direction feels right for your project?\"\n\n### 2. Analyze Project Requirements\n\nGuide decision based on project context:\n\"**Let's consider your specific needs:**\n\n**Based on our previous conversations:**\n\n- Platform: [platform from step 3]\n- Timeline: [inferred from user conversation]\n- Team Size: [inferred from user conversation]\n- Brand Requirements: [inferred from user conversation]\n- Technical Constraints: [inferred from user conversation]\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n\n- Need for speed vs. need for uniqueness\n- Brand guidelines or existing visual identity\n- Team's design expertise\n- Long-term maintenance considerations\n- Integration requirements with existing systems\"\n\n### 3. Explore Specific Design System Options\n\nDive deeper into relevant options:\n\"**Recommended Options Based on Your Needs:**\n\n**For [Your Platform Type]:**\n\n- [Option 1] - [Key benefit] - [Best for scenario]\n- [Option 2] - [Key benefit] - [Best for scenario]\n- [Option 3] - [Key benefit] - [Best for scenario]\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n- Component library size and quality\n- Documentation and community support\n- Customization capabilities\n- Accessibility compliance\n- Performance characteristics\n- Learning curve for your team\"\n\n### 4. Facilitate Decision Process\n\nHelp user make informed choice:\n\"**Decision Framework:**\n\n1. What's most important: Speed, uniqueness, or balance?\n2. How much design expertise does your team have?\n3. Are there existing brand guidelines to follow?\n4. What's your timeline and budget?\n5. Long-term maintenance needs?\n\nLet's evaluate options based on your answers to these questions.\"\n\n### 5. Finalize Design System Choice\n\nConfirm and document the decision:\n\"Based on our analysis, I recommend [Design System Choice] for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- [Reason 1 based on project needs]\n- [Reason 2 based on constraints]\n- [Reason 3 based on team considerations]\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n- We'll customize this system to match your brand and needs\n- Define component strategy for custom components needed\n- Establish design tokens and patterns\n\nDoes this design system choice feel right to you?\"\n\n### 6. Generate Design System Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Design System Foundation\n\n### 1.1 Design System Choice\n\n[Design system choice based on conversation]\n\n### Rationale for Selection\n\n[Rationale for design system selection based on conversation]\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n[Implementation approach based on chosen system]\n\n### Customization Strategy\n\n[Customization strategy based on project needs]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated design system content and present choices:\n\"I've documented our design system choice for {{project_name}}. This foundation will ensure consistency and speed up development.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine our design system decision\n[P] Party Mode - Bring technical perspectives on design systems\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to defining experience\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml with the current design system content\n- Process the enhanced design system insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the design system decision? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current design system choice\n- Process the collaborative design system insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the design system decision? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: append step to end of stepsCompleted array\n- Load `./step-07-defining-experience.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Design system options clearly presented and explained\n✅ Decision framework applied to project requirements\n✅ Specific design system chosen with clear rationale\n✅ Implementation approach planned\n✅ Customization strategy defined\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not explaining design system concepts clearly\n❌ Rushing to recommendation without understanding requirements\n❌ Not considering technical constraints or team capabilities\n❌ Choosing design system without clear rationale\n❌ Not planning implementation approach\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-07-defining-experience.md` to define the core user interaction.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-07 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Identify the Defining Experience\n\nFocus on the core interaction:\n\"Every successful product has a defining experience - the core interaction that, if we nail it, everything else follows.\n\n**Think about these famous examples:**\n\n- Tinder: \"Swipe to match with people\"\n- Snapchat: \"Share photos that disappear\"\n- Instagram: \"Share perfect moments with filters\"\n- Spotify: \"Discover and play any song instantly\"\n\n**For {{project_name}}:**\nWhat's the core action that users will describe to their friends?\nWhat's the interaction that makes users feel successful?\nIf we get ONE thing perfectly right, what should it be?\"\n\n### 2. Explore the User's Mental Model\n\nUnderstand how users think about the core task:\n\"**User Mental Model Questions:**\n\n- How do users currently solve this problem?\n- What mental model do they bring to this task?\n- What's their expectation for how this should work?\n- Where are they likely to get confused or frustrated?\n\n**Current Solutions:**\n\n- What do users love/hate about existing approaches?\n- What shortcuts or workarounds do they use?\n- What makes existing solutions feel magical or terrible?\"\n\n### 3. Define Success Criteria for Core Experience\n\nEstablish what makes the core interaction successful:\n\"**Core Experience Success Criteria:**\n\n- What makes users say 'this just works'?\n- When do they feel smart or accomplished?\n- What feedback tells them they're doing it right?\n- How fast should it feel?\n- What should happen automatically?\n\n**Success Indicators:**\n\n- [Success indicator 1]\n- [Success indicator 2]\n- [Success indicator 3]\"\n\n### 4. Identify Novel vs. Established Patterns\n\nDetermine if we need to innovate or can use proven patterns:\n\"**Pattern Analysis:**\nLooking at your core experience, does this:\n\n- Use established UX patterns that users already understand?\n- Require novel interaction design that needs user education?\n- Combine familiar patterns in innovative ways?\n\n**If Novel:**\n\n- What makes this different from existing approaches?\n- How will we teach users this new pattern?\n- What familiar metaphors can we use?\n\n**If Established:**\n\n- Which proven patterns should we adopt?\n- How can we innovate within familiar patterns?\n- What's our unique twist on established interactions?\"\n\n### 5. Define Experience Mechanics\n\nBreak down the core interaction into details:\n\"**Core Experience Mechanics:**\nLet's design the step-by-step flow for [defining experience]:\n\n**1. Initiation:**\n\n- How does the user start this action?\n- What triggers or invites them to begin?\n\n**2. Interaction:**\n\n- What does the user actually do?\n- What controls or inputs do they use?\n- How does the system respond?\n\n**3. Feedback:**\n\n- What tells users they're succeeding?\n- How do they know when it's working?\n- What happens if they make a mistake?\n\n**4. Completion:**\n\n- How do users know they're done?\n- What's the successful outcome?\n- What's next?\"\n\n### 6. Generate Defining Experience Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## 2. Core User Experience\n\n### 2.1 Defining Experience\n\n[Defining experience description based on conversation]\n\n### 2.2 User Mental Model\n\n[User mental model analysis based on conversation]\n\n### 2.3 Success Criteria\n\n[Success criteria for core experience based on conversation]\n\n### 2.4 Novel UX Patterns\n\n[Novel UX patterns analysis based on conversation]\n\n### 2.5 Experience Mechanics\n\n[Detailed mechanics for core experience based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated defining experience content and present choices:\n\"I've defined the core experience for {{project_name}} - the interaction that will make users love this product.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine the core experience definition\n[P] Party Mode - Bring different perspectives on the defining interaction\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to visual foundation\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml with the current defining experience content\n- Process the enhanced experience insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the defining experience? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current defining experience\n- Process the collaborative experience insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the defining experience? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: append step to end of stepsCompleted array\n- Load `./step-08-visual-foundation.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Defining experience clearly articulated\n✅ User mental model thoroughly analyzed\n✅ Success criteria established for core interaction\n✅ Novel vs. established patterns properly evaluated\n✅ Experience mechanics designed in detail\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not identifying the true core interaction\n❌ Missing user's mental model and expectations\n❌ Not establishing clear success criteria\n❌ Not properly evaluating novel vs. established patterns\n❌ Experience mechanics too vague or incomplete\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-08-visual-foundation.md` to establish visual design foundation.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-08 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Brand Guidelines Assessment\n\nCheck for existing brand requirements:\n\"Do you have existing brand guidelines or a specific color palette I should follow? (y/n)\n\nIf yes, I'll extract and document your brand colors and create semantic color mappings.\nIf no, I'll generate theme options based on your project's personality and emotional goals from our earlier discussion.\"\n\n### 2. Generate Color Theme Options (If no brand guidelines)\n\nCreate visual exploration opportunities:\n\"If no existing brand guidelines, I'll create a color theme visualizer to help you explore options.\n\n🎨 I can generate comprehensive HTML color theme visualizers with multiple theme options, complete UI examples, and the ability to see how colors work in real interface contexts.\n\nThis will help you make an informed decision about the visual direction for {{project_name}}.\"\n\n### 3. Define Typography System\n\nEstablish the typographic foundation:\n\"**Typography Questions:**\n\n- What should the overall tone feel like? (Professional, friendly, modern, classic?)\n- How much text content will users read? (Headings only? Long-form content?)\n- Any accessibility requirements for font sizes or contrast?\n- Any brand fonts we must use?\n\n**Typography Strategy:**\n\n- Choose primary and secondary typefaces\n- Establish type scale (h1, h2, h3, body, etc.)\n- Define line heights and spacing relationships\n- Consider readability and accessibility\"\n\n### 4. Establish Spacing and Layout Foundation\n\nDefine the structural foundation:\n\"**Spacing and Layout Foundation:**\n\n- How should the overall layout feel? (Dense and efficient? Airy and spacious?)\n- What spacing unit should we use? (4px, 8px, 12px base?)\n- How much white space should be between elements?\n- Should we use a grid system? If so, what column structure?\n\n**Layout Principles:**\n\n- [Layout principle 1 based on product type]\n- [Layout principle 2 based on user needs]\n- [Layout principle 3 based on platform requirements]\"\n\n### 5. Create Visual Foundation Strategy\n\nSynthesize all visual decisions:\n\"**Visual Foundation Strategy:**\n\n**Color System:**\n\n- [Color strategy based on brand guidelines or generated themes]\n- Semantic color mapping (primary, secondary, success, warning, error, etc.)\n- Accessibility compliance (contrast ratios)\n\n**Typography System:**\n\n- [Typography strategy based on content needs and tone]\n- Type scale and hierarchy\n- Font pairing rationale\n\n**Spacing & Layout:**\n\n- [Spacing strategy based on content density and platform]\n- Grid system approach\n- Component spacing relationships\n\nThis foundation will ensure consistency across all our design decisions.\"\n\n### 6. Generate Visual Foundation Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Visual Design Foundation\n\n### Color System\n\n[Color system strategy based on conversation]\n\n### Typography System\n\n[Typography system strategy based on conversation]\n\n### Spacing & Layout Foundation\n\n[Spacing and layout foundation based on conversation]\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\n[Accessibility considerations based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated visual foundation content and present choices:\n\"I've established the visual design foundation for {{project_name}}. This provides the building blocks for consistent, beautiful design.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine our visual foundation\n[P] Party Mode - Bring design perspectives on visual choices\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to design directions\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml with the current visual foundation content\n- Process the enhanced visual insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the visual foundation? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current visual foundation\n- Process the collaborative visual insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the visual foundation? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: append step to end of stepsCompleted array\n- Load `./step-09-design-directions.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Brand guidelines assessed and incorporated if available\n✅ Color system established with accessibility consideration\n✅ Typography system defined with appropriate hierarchy\n✅ Spacing and layout foundation created\n✅ Visual foundation strategy documented\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not checking for existing brand guidelines first\n❌ Color palette not aligned with emotional goals\n❌ Typography not suitable for content type or readability needs\n❌ Spacing system not appropriate for content density\n❌ Missing accessibility considerations\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-09-design-directions.md` to generate design direction mockups.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-09 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Generate Design Direction Variations\n\nCreate diverse visual explorations:\n\"I'll generate 6-8 different design direction variations exploring:\n\n- Different layout approaches and information hierarchy\n- Various interaction patterns and visual weights\n- Alternative color applications from our foundation\n- Different density and spacing approaches\n- Various navigation and component arrangements\n\nEach mockup will show a complete vision for {{project_name}} with all our design decisions applied.\"\n\n### 2. Create HTML Design Direction Showcase\n\nGenerate interactive visual exploration:\n\"🎨 Design Direction Mockups Generated!\n\nI'm creating a comprehensive HTML design direction showcase at `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-directions.html`\n\n**What you'll see:**\n\n- 6-8 full-screen mockup variations\n- Interactive states and hover effects\n- Side-by-side comparison tools\n- Complete UI examples with real content\n- Responsive behavior demonstrations\n\nEach mockup represents a complete visual direction for your app's look and feel.\"\n\n### 3. Present Design Exploration Framework\n\nGuide evaluation criteria:\n\"As you explore the design directions, look for:\n\n✅ **Layout Intuitiveness** - Which information hierarchy matches your priorities?\n✅ **Interaction Style** - Which interaction style fits your core experience?\n✅ **Visual Weight** - Which visual density feels right for your brand?\n✅ **Navigation Approach** - Which navigation pattern matches user expectations?\n✅ **Component Usage** - How well do the components support your user journeys?\n✅ **Brand Alignment** - Which direction best supports your emotional goals?\n\nTake your time exploring - this is a crucial decision that will guide all our design work!\"\n\n### 4. Facilitate Design Direction Selection\n\nHelp user choose or combine elements:\n\"After exploring all the design directions:\n\n**Which approach resonates most with you?**\n\n- Pick a favorite direction as-is\n- Combine elements from multiple directions\n- Request modifications to any direction\n- Use one direction as a base and iterate\n\n**Tell me:**\n\n- Which layout feels most intuitive for your users?\n- Which visual weight matches your brand personality?\n- Which interaction style supports your core experience?\n- Are there elements from different directions you'd like to combine?\"\n\n### 5. Document Design Direction Decision\n\nCapture the chosen approach:\n\"Based on your exploration, I'm understanding your design direction preference:\n\n**Chosen Direction:** [Direction number or combination]\n**Key Elements:** [Specific elements you liked]\n**Modifications Needed:** [Any changes requested]\n**Rationale:** [Why this direction works for your product]\n\nThis will become our design foundation moving forward. Are we ready to lock this in, or do you want to explore variations?\"\n\n### 6. Generate Design Direction Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Design Direction Decision\n\n### Design Directions Explored\n\n[Summary of design directions explored based on conversation]\n\n### Chosen Direction\n\n[Chosen design direction based on conversation]\n\n### Design Rationale\n\n[Rationale for design direction choice based on conversation]\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n[Implementation approach based on chosen direction]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated design direction content and present choices:\n\"I've documented our design direction decision for {{project_name}}. This visual approach will guide all our detailed design work.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine our design direction\n[P] Party Mode - Bring different perspectives on visual choices\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to user journey flows\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml with the current design direction content\n- Process the enhanced design insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the design direction? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current design direction\n- Process the collaborative design insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the design direction? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: append step to end of stepsCompleted array\n- Load `./step-10-user-journeys.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Multiple design direction variations generated\n✅ HTML showcase created with interactive elements\n✅ Design evaluation criteria clearly established\n✅ User able to explore and compare directions effectively\n✅ Design direction decision made with clear rationale\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not creating enough variation in design directions\n❌ Design directions not aligned with established foundation\n❌ Missing interactive elements in HTML showcase\n❌ Not providing clear evaluation criteria\n❌ Rushing decision without thorough exploration\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-10-user-journeys.md` to design user journey flows.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-10 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Load PRD User Journeys as Foundation\n\nStart with user journeys already defined in the PRD:\n\"Great! Since we have the PRD available, let's build on the user journeys already documented there.\n\n**Existing User Journeys from PRD:**\nI've already loaded these user journeys from your PRD:\n[Journey narratives from PRD input documents]\n\nThese journeys tell us **who** users are and **why** they take certain actions. Now we need to design **how** those journeys work in detail.\n\n**Critical Journeys to Design Flows For:**\nLooking at the PRD journeys, I need to design detailed interaction flows for:\n\n- [Critical journey 1 identified from PRD narratives]\n- [Critical journey 2 identified from PRD narratives]\n- [Critical journey 3 identified from PRD narratives]\n\nThe PRD gave us the stories - now we design the mechanics!\"\n\n### 2. Design Each Journey Flow\n\nFor each critical journey, design detailed flow:\n\n**For [Journey Name]:**\n\"Let's design the flow for users accomplishing [journey goal].\n\n**Flow Design Questions:**\n\n- How do users start this journey? (entry point)\n- What information do they need at each step?\n- What decisions do they need to make?\n- How do they know they're progressing successfully?\n- What does success look like for this journey?\n- Where might they get confused or stuck?\n- How do they recover from errors?\"\n\n### 3. Create Flow Diagrams\n\nVisualize each journey with Mermaid diagrams:\n\"I'll create detailed flow diagrams for each journey showing:\n\n**[Journey Name] Flow:**\n\n- Entry points and triggers\n- Decision points and branches\n- Success and failure paths\n- Error recovery mechanisms\n- Progressive disclosure of information\n\nEach diagram will map the complete user experience from start to finish.\"\n\n### 4. Optimize for Efficiency and Delight\n\nRefine flows for optimal user experience:\n\"**Flow Optimization:**\nFor each journey, let's ensure we're:\n\n- Minimizing steps to value (getting users to success quickly)\n- Reducing cognitive load at each decision point\n- Providing clear feedback and progress indicators\n- Creating moments of delight or accomplishment\n- Handling edge cases and error recovery gracefully\n\n**Specific Optimizations:**\n\n- [Optimization 1 for journey efficiency]\n- [Optimization 2 for user delight]\n- [Optimization 3 for error handling]\"\n\n### 5. Document Journey Patterns\n\nExtract reusable patterns across journeys:\n\"**Journey Patterns:**\nAcross these flows, I'm seeing some common patterns we can standardize:\n\n**Navigation Patterns:**\n\n- [Navigation pattern 1]\n- [Navigation pattern 2]\n\n**Decision Patterns:**\n\n- [Decision pattern 1]\n- [Decision pattern 2]\n\n**Feedback Patterns:**\n\n- [Feedback pattern 1]\n- [Feedback pattern 2]\n\nThese patterns will ensure consistency across all user experiences.\"\n\n### 6. Generate User Journey Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## User Journey Flows\n\n### [Journey 1 Name]\n\n[Journey 1 description and Mermaid diagram]\n\n### [Journey 2 Name]\n\n[Journey 2 description and Mermaid diagram]\n\n### Journey Patterns\n\n[Journey patterns identified based on conversation]\n\n### Flow Optimization Principles\n\n[Flow optimization principles based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated user journey content and present choices:\n\"I've designed detailed user journey flows for {{project_name}}. These flows will guide the detailed design of each user interaction.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine our user journey designs\n[P] Party Mode - Bring different perspectives on user flows\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to component strategy\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml with the current user journey content\n- Process the enhanced journey insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the user journeys? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current user journeys\n- Process the collaborative journey insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the user journeys? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: append step to end of stepsCompleted array\n- Load `./step-11-component-strategy.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Critical user journeys identified and designed\n✅ Detailed flow diagrams created for each journey\n✅ Flows optimized for efficiency and user delight\n✅ Common journey patterns extracted and documented\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not identifying all critical user journeys\n❌ Flows too complex or not optimized for user success\n❌ Missing error recovery paths\n❌ Not extracting reusable patterns across journeys\n❌ Flow diagrams unclear or incomplete\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-11-component-strategy.md` to define component library strategy.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-11 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Analyze Design System Coverage\n\nReview what components are available vs. needed:\n\"Based on our chosen design system [design system from step 6], let's identify what components are already available and what we need to create custom.\n\n**Available from Design System:**\n[List of components available in chosen design system]\n\n**Components Needed for {{project_name}}:**\nLooking at our user journeys and design direction, we need:\n\n- [Component need 1 from journey analysis]\n- [Component need 2 from design requirements]\n- [Component need 3 from core experience]\n\n**Gap Analysis:**\n\n- [Gap 1 - needed but not available]\n- [Gap 2 - needed but not available]\"\n\n### 2. Design Custom Components\n\nFor each custom component needed, design thoroughly:\n\n**For each custom component:**\n\"**[Component Name] Design:**\n\n**Purpose:** What does this component do for users?\n**Content:** What information or data does it display?\n**Actions:** What can users do with this component?\n**States:** What different states does it have? (default, hover, active, disabled, error, etc.)\n**Variants:** Are there different sizes or styles needed?\n**Accessibility:** What ARIA labels and keyboard support needed?\n\nLet's walk through each custom component systematically.\"\n\n### 3. Document Component Specifications\n\nCreate detailed specifications for each component:\n\n**Component Specification Template:**\n\n```markdown\n### [Component Name]\n\n**Purpose:** [Clear purpose statement]\n**Usage:** [When and how to use]\n**Anatomy:** [Visual breakdown of parts]\n**States:** [All possible states with descriptions]\n**Variants:** [Different sizes/styles if applicable]\n**Accessibility:** [ARIA labels, keyboard navigation]\n**Content Guidelines:** [What content works best]\n**Interaction Behavior:** [How users interact]\n```\n\n### 4. Define Component Strategy\n\nEstablish overall component library approach:\n\"**Component Strategy:**\n\n**Foundation Components:** (from design system)\n\n- [Foundation component 1]\n- [Foundation component 2]\n\n**Custom Components:** (designed in this step)\n\n- [Custom component 1 with rationale]\n- [Custom component 2 with rationale]\n\n**Implementation Approach:**\n\n- Build custom components using design system tokens\n- Ensure consistency with established patterns\n- Follow accessibility best practices\n- Create reusable patterns for common use cases\"\n\n### 5. Plan Implementation Roadmap\n\nDefine how and when to build components:\n\"**Implementation Roadmap:**\n\n**Phase 1 - Core Components:**\n\n- [Component 1] - needed for [critical flow]\n- [Component 2] - needed for [critical flow]\n\n**Phase 2 - Supporting Components:**\n\n- [Component 3] - enhances [user experience]\n- [Component 4] - supports [design pattern]\n\n**Phase 3 - Enhancement Components:**\n\n- [Component 5] - optimizes [user journey]\n- [Component 6] - adds [special feature]\n\nThis roadmap helps prioritize development based on user journey criticality.\"\n\n### 6. Generate Component Strategy Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Component Strategy\n\n### Design System Components\n\n[Analysis of available design system components based on conversation]\n\n### Custom Components\n\n[Custom component specifications based on conversation]\n\n### Component Implementation Strategy\n\n[Component implementation strategy based on conversation]\n\n### Implementation Roadmap\n\n[Implementation roadmap based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated component strategy content and present choices:\n\"I've defined the component strategy for {{project_name}}. This balances using proven design system components with custom components for your unique needs.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine our component strategy\n[P] Party Mode - Bring technical perspectives on component design\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to UX patterns\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml with the current component strategy content\n- Process the enhanced component insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the component strategy? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current component strategy\n- Process the collaborative component insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the component strategy? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: append step to end of stepsCompleted array\n- Load `./step-12-ux-patterns.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Design system coverage properly analyzed\n✅ All custom components thoroughly specified\n✅ Component strategy clearly defined\n✅ Implementation roadmap prioritized by user need\n✅ Accessibility considered for all components\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not analyzing design system coverage properly\n❌ Custom components not thoroughly specified\n❌ Missing accessibility considerations\n❌ Component strategy not aligned with user journeys\n❌ Implementation roadmap not prioritized effectively\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-12-ux-patterns.md` to define UX consistency patterns.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-12 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Identify Pattern Categories\n\nDetermine which patterns need definition for your product:\n\"Let's establish consistency patterns for how {{project_name}} behaves in common situations.\n\n**Pattern Categories to Define:**\n\n- Button hierarchy and actions\n- Feedback patterns (success, error, warning, info)\n- Form patterns and validation\n- Navigation patterns\n- Modal and overlay patterns\n- Empty states and loading states\n- Search and filtering patterns\n\nWhich categories are most critical for your product? We can go through each thoroughly or focus on the most important ones.\"\n\n### 2. Define Critical Patterns First\n\nFocus on patterns most relevant to your product:\n\n**For [Critical Pattern Category]:**\n\"**[Pattern Type] Patterns:**\nWhat should users see/do when they need to [pattern action]?\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n- Visual hierarchy (primary vs. secondary actions)\n- Feedback mechanisms\n- Error recovery\n- Accessibility requirements\n- Mobile vs. desktop considerations\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- [Example 1 for this pattern type]\n- [Example 2 for this pattern type]\n\nHow should {{project_name}} handle [pattern type] interactions?\"\n\n### 3. Establish Pattern Guidelines\n\nDocument specific design decisions:\n\n**Pattern Guidelines Template:**\n\n```markdown\n### [Pattern Type]\n\n**When to Use:** [Clear usage guidelines]\n**Visual Design:** [How it should look]\n**Behavior:** [How it should interact]\n**Accessibility:** [A11y requirements]\n**Mobile Considerations:** [Mobile-specific needs]\n**Variants:** [Different states or styles if applicable]\n```\n\n### 4. Design System Integration\n\nEnsure patterns work with chosen design system:\n\"**Integration with [Design System]:**\n\n- How do these patterns complement our design system components?\n- What customizations are needed?\n- How do we maintain consistency while meeting unique needs?\n\n**Custom Pattern Rules:**\n\n- [Custom rule 1]\n- [Custom rule 2]\n- [Custom rule 3]\"\n\n### 5. Create Pattern Documentation\n\nGenerate comprehensive pattern library:\n\n**Pattern Library Structure:**\n\n- Clear usage guidelines for each pattern\n- Visual examples and specifications\n- Implementation notes for developers\n- Accessibility checklists\n- Mobile-first considerations\n\n### 6. Generate UX Patterns Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## UX Consistency Patterns\n\n### Button Hierarchy\n\n[Button hierarchy patterns based on conversation]\n\n### Feedback Patterns\n\n[Feedback patterns based on conversation]\n\n### Form Patterns\n\n[Form patterns based on conversation]\n\n### Navigation Patterns\n\n[Navigation patterns based on conversation]\n\n### Additional Patterns\n\n[Additional patterns based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated UX patterns content and present choices:\n\"I've established UX consistency patterns for {{project_name}}. These patterns ensure users have a consistent, predictable experience across all interactions.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine our UX patterns\n[P] Party Mode - Bring different perspectives on consistency patterns\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and move to responsive design\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml with the current UX patterns content\n- Process the enhanced pattern insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the UX patterns? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current UX patterns\n- Process the collaborative pattern insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the UX patterns? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: append step to end of stepsCompleted array\n- Load `./step-13-responsive-accessibility.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Critical pattern categories identified and prioritized\n✅ Consistency patterns clearly defined and documented\n✅ Patterns integrated with chosen design system\n✅ Accessibility considerations included for all patterns\n✅ Mobile-first approach incorporated\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not identifying the most critical pattern categories\n❌ Patterns too generic or not actionable\n❌ Missing accessibility considerations\n❌ Patterns not aligned with design system\n❌ Not considering mobile differences\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-13-responsive-accessibility.md` to define responsive design and accessibility strategy.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-13 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Define Responsive Strategy\n\nEstablish how the design adapts across devices:\n\"Let's define how {{project_name}} adapts across different screen sizes and devices.\n\n**Responsive Design Questions:**\n\n**Desktop Strategy:**\n\n- How should we use extra screen real estate?\n- Multi-column layouts, side navigation, or content density?\n- What desktop-specific features can we include?\n\n**Tablet Strategy:**\n\n- Should we use simplified layouts or touch-optimized interfaces?\n- How do gestures and touch interactions work on tablets?\n- What's the optimal information density for tablet screens?\n\n**Mobile Strategy:**\n\n- Bottom navigation or hamburger menu?\n- How do layouts collapse on small screens?\n- What's the most critical information to show mobile-first?\"\n\n### 2. Establish Breakpoint Strategy\n\nDefine when and how layouts change:\n\"**Breakpoint Strategy:**\nWe need to define screen size breakpoints where layouts adapt.\n\n**Common Breakpoints:**\n\n- Mobile: 320px - 767px\n- Tablet: 768px - 1023px\n- Desktop: 1024px+\n\n**For {{project_name}}, should we:**\n\n- Use standard breakpoints or custom ones?\n- Focus on mobile-first or desktop-first design?\n- Have specific breakpoints for your key use cases?\"\n\n### 3. Design Accessibility Strategy\n\nDefine accessibility requirements and compliance level:\n\"**Accessibility Strategy:**\nWhat level of WCAG compliance does {{project_name}} need?\n\n**WCAG Levels:**\n\n- **Level A (Basic)** - Essential accessibility for legal compliance\n- **Level AA (Recommended)** - Industry standard for good UX\n- **Level AAA (Highest)** - Exceptional accessibility (rarely needed)\n\n**Based on your product:**\n\n- [Recommendation based on user base, legal requirements, etc.]\n\n**Key Accessibility Considerations:**\n\n- Color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text)\n- Keyboard navigation support\n- Screen reader compatibility\n- Touch target sizes (minimum 44x44px)\n- Focus indicators and skip links\"\n\n### 4. Define Testing Strategy\n\nPlan how to ensure responsive design and accessibility:\n\"**Testing Strategy:**\n\n**Responsive Testing:**\n\n- Device testing on actual phones/tablets\n- Browser testing across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge\n- Real device network performance testing\n\n**Accessibility Testing:**\n\n- Automated accessibility testing tools\n- Screen reader testing (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS)\n- Keyboard-only navigation testing\n- Color blindness simulation testing\n\n**User Testing:**\n\n- Include users with disabilities in testing\n- Test with diverse assistive technologies\n- Validate with actual target devices\"\n\n### 5. Document Implementation Guidelines\n\nCreate specific guidelines for developers:\n\"**Implementation Guidelines:**\n\n**Responsive Development:**\n\n- Use relative units (rem, %, vw, vh) over fixed pixels\n- Implement mobile-first media queries\n- Test touch targets and gesture areas\n- Optimize images and assets for different devices\n\n**Accessibility Development:**\n\n- Semantic HTML structure\n- ARIA labels and roles\n- Keyboard navigation implementation\n- Focus management and skip links\n- High contrast mode support\"\n\n### 6. Generate Responsive & Accessibility Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\nWhen saving to document, append these Level 2 and Level 3 sections:\n\n```markdown\n## Responsive Design & Accessibility\n\n### Responsive Strategy\n\n[Responsive strategy based on conversation]\n\n### Breakpoint Strategy\n\n[Breakpoint strategy based on conversation]\n\n### Accessibility Strategy\n\n[Accessibility strategy based on conversation]\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n[Testing strategy based on conversation]\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\n[Implementation guidelines based on conversation]\n```\n\n### 7. Present Content and Menu\n\nShow the generated responsive and accessibility content and present choices:\n\"I've defined the responsive design and accessibility strategy for {{project_name}}. This ensures your product works beautifully across all devices and is accessible to all users.\n\n**Here's what I'll add to the document:**\n\n[Show the complete markdown content from step 6]\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[A] Advanced Elicitation - Let's refine our responsive/accessibility strategy\n[P] Party Mode - Bring different perspectives on inclusive design\n[C] Continue - Save this to the document and complete the workflow\n\n### 8. Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml with the current responsive/accessibility content\n- Process the enhanced insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these improvements to the responsive/accessibility strategy? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with the current responsive/accessibility strategy\n- Process the collaborative insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the responsive/accessibility strategy? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content with improvements, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-specification.md`\n- Update frontmatter: append step to end of stepsCompleted array\n- Load `./step-14-complete.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Responsive strategy clearly defined for all device types\n✅ Appropriate breakpoint strategy established\n✅ Accessibility requirements determined and documented\n✅ Comprehensive testing strategy planned\n✅ Implementation guidelines provided for development team\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not considering all device types and screen sizes\n❌ Accessibility requirements not properly researched\n❌ Testing strategy not comprehensive enough\n❌ Implementation guidelines too generic or unclear\n❌ Not addressing specific accessibility challenges for your product\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n❌ Appending content without user selecting 'C'\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-14-complete.md` to finalize the UX design workflow.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-14 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).
