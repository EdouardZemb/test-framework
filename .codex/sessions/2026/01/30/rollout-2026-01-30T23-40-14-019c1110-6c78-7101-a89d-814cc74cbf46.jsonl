You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"},"git":{}}}

Check for Existing Workflow\n\nFirst, check if the output document already exists:\n\n- Look for existing {planning_artifacts}/`*architecture*.md`\n- If exists, read the complete file(s) including frontmatter\n- If not exists, this is a fresh workflow\n\n### 2. Handle Continuation (If Document Exists)\n\nIf the document exists and has frontmatter with `stepsCompleted`:\n\n- **STOP here** and load `./step-01b-continue.md` immediately\n- Do not proceed with any initialization tasks\n- Let step-01b handle the continuation logic\n\n### 3. Fresh Workflow Setup (If No Document)\n\nIf no document exists or no `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter:\n\n#### A. Input Document Discovery\n\nDiscover and load context documents using smart discovery. Documents can be in the following locations:\n- {planning_artifacts}/**\n- {output_folder}/**\n- {product_knowledge}/**\n- docs/**\n\nAlso - when searching - documents can be a single markdown file, or a folder with an index and multiple files. For Example, if searching for `*foo*.md` and not found, also search for a folder called *foo*/index.md (which indicates sharded content)\n\nTry to discover the following:\n- Product Brief (`*brief*.md`)\n- Product Requirements Document (`*prd*.md`)\n- UX Design (`*ux-design*.md`) and other\n- Research Documents (`*research*.md`)\n- Project Documentation (generally multiple documents might be found for this in the `{product_knowledge}` or `docs` folder.)\n- Project Context (`**/project-context.md`)\n\n<critical>Confirm what you have found with the user, along with asking if the user wants to provide anything else. Only after this confirmation will you proceed to follow the loading rules</critical>\n\n**Loading Rules:**\n\n- Load ALL discovered files completely that the user confirmed or provided (no offset/limit)\n- If there is a project context, whatever is relevant should try to be biased in the remainder of this whole workflow process\n- For sharded folders, load ALL files to get complete picture, using the index first to potentially know the potential of each document\n- index.md is a guide to what's relevant whenever available\n- Track all successfully loaded files in frontmatter `inputDocuments` array\n\n#### B. Validate Required Inputs\n\nBefore proceeding, verify we have the essential inputs:\n\n**PRD Validation:**\n\n- If no PRD found: \"Architecture requires a PRD to work from. Please run the PRD workflow first or provide the PRD file path.\"\n- Do NOT proceed without PRD\n\n**Other Input that might exist:**\n\n- UX Spec: \"Provides UI/UX architectural requirements\"\n\n#### C. Create Initial Document\n\nCopy the template from `{installed_path}/architecture-decision-template.md` to `{planning_artifacts}/architecture.md`\n\n#### D. Complete Initialization and Report\n\nComplete setup and report to user:\n\n**Document Setup:**\n\n- Created: `{planning_artifacts}/architecture.md` from template\n- Initialized frontmatter with workflow state\n\n**Input Documents Discovered:**\nReport what was found:\n\"Welcome {{user_name}}! I've set up your Architecture workspace for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Documents Found:**\n\n- PRD: {number of PRD files loaded or \"None found - REQUIRED\"}\n- UX Design: {number of UX files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Research: {number of research files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Project docs: {number of project files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Project context: {project_context_rules count of rules for AI agents found}\n\n**Files loaded:** {list of specific file names or \"No additional documents found\"}\n\nReady to begin architectural decision making. Do you have any other documents you'd like me to include?\n\n[C] Continue to project context analysis\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Existing workflow detected and handed off to step-01b correctly\n✅ Fresh workflow initialized with template and frontmatter\n✅ Input documents discovered and loaded using sharded-first logic\n✅ All discovered files tracked in frontmatter `inputDocuments`\n✅ PRD requirement validated and communicated\n✅ User confirmed document setup and can proceed\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Proceeding with fresh initialization when existing workflow exists\n❌ Not updating frontmatter with discovered input documents\n❌ Creating document without proper template\n❌ Not checking sharded folders first before whole files\n❌ Not reporting what documents were found to user\n❌ Proceeding without validating PRD requirement\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects [C] to continue, only after ensuring all the template output has been created, then load `./step-02-context.md` to analyze the project context and begin architectural decision making.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-02 until user explicitly selects [C] from the menu and setup is confirmed!\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._\n\n\n## Project Context Analysis\n\n### Requirements Overview\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nLe produit couvre un flux QA complet via CLI : ingestion/triage (Jira/Squash), checklist testabilité et scoring Go/Clarify/No‑Go, génération assistée de stratégies/cas/anomalies, gestion des preuves et campagnes (TNR), reporting quotidien/hebdo, exports multi‑formats, configuration par projet/profil et modes interactif/batch. L’architecture devra soutenir des workflows guidés, des modules réutilisables, et une traçabilité forte (preuves ↔ cas ↔ anomalies ↔ tickets).\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\n- Sécurité & privacy strictes : LLM local prioritaire, anonymisation obligatoire avant cloud, secrets via secret store, least privilege.\n- Conformité & audit : logs minimaux sans données sensibles, rétention 90 jours, purge données locales < 24h.\n- Performance : CLI réactive, extraction & génération rapides.\n- Fiabilité : reprise/replay, mode dégradé si intégrations indisponibles.\n- Compatibilité : intégrations Jira/Squash/SharePoint/Office, sorties conformes aux templates.\n- Contraintes IT : proxy, droits d’installation, scripts signés possibles, exécution sur poste M365.\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\nProjet d’automatisation QA multi‑outils avec forte contrainte de conformité et plusieurs workflows critiques.\n\n- Primary domain: CLI tool / QA process automation / integrations\n- Complexity level: high\n- Estimated architectural components: ~10–12 (connecteurs, orchestration, templates, stockage, anonymisation, logs, config/profiles, export, diagnostics, UX CLI)\n\n### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n- Jira (token) et Squash (Basic auth initialement), SharePoint comme source de preuves/livrables.\n- LLM local requis, cloud optionnel uniquement avec anonymisation automatique.\n- Données sensibles minimisées, chiffrement au repos, purge locale.\n- Environnement poste M365, restrictions IT (proxy, scripts signés, droits).\n\n### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n- Privacy & anonymisation by design\n- Gestion des secrets et least‑privilege\n- Observabilité minimale (logs sans données sensibles)\n- Traçabilité preuves ↔ tickets ↔ anomalies ↔ campagnes\n- Mode dégradé + replay en cas d’échec d’intégration\n- Standardisation des templates & formats d’export\n- Configuration multi‑projets/profils\n\n### Architectural Decision Areas (ADR‑style, à trancher ensuite)\n\n1. **Orchestration CLI (interactif vs batch)**\n   - Options : moteur de workflow unique vs pipelines spécialisés par commande\n   - Trade‑offs : simplicité d’usage vs flexibilité multi‑projets\n\n2. **Intégrations & mode dégradé**\n   - Options : connecteurs API natifs vs import/export CSV en fallback systématique\n   - Trade‑offs : robustesse offline vs complexité de mapping\n\n3. **Sécurité & anonymisation**\n   - Options : anonymisation inline (pipeline) vs service dédié\n   - Trade‑offs : performance locale vs séparation des responsabilités\n\n4. **Stockage & traçabilité**\n   - Options : stockage local chiffré minimal vs cache plus riche\n   - Trade‑offs : performance/replay vs exigences de purge\n\n5. **Templates & standardisation**\n   - Options : templates versionnés dans repo vs templates externes (SharePoint)\n   - Trade‑offs : contrôle/versionning vs adoption par le client\n\n6. **Observabilité minimale**\n   - Options : logs structurés locaux vs journalisation centralisée (si autorisée)\n   - Trade‑offs : conformité IT vs facilité de diagnostic\n\n### Pre‑mortem (risques majeurs à prévenir)\n\n- **Échec d’adoption** : flux trop verbeux, surcharge de flags, pas assez “run unique”.\n- **Blocage IT** : proxy/sécurité empêche API → besoin d’un mode dégradé CSV réellement utilisable.\n- **Fuite de données** : anonymisation incomplète avant cloud → obligation d’un pipeline de masquage vérifiable.\n- **Qualité des sorties insuffisante** : templates non alignés client → versionning/validation des templates requis.\n- **Données incohérentes** : mappings Jira/Squash/Excel divergents → besoin d’un mapping central et d’un audit minimal.\n- **Temps d’exécution trop long** : extraction lente → stratégie de cache minimale et mode “scope réduit”.\n- **Diagnostic impossible** : logs trop pauvres → logs structurés sans données sensibles + replay.\n\n### Comparative Decision Matrix (critères pour trancher)\n\n**1) Orchestration**\n- Options : workflow unique vs pipelines par commande\n- Critères : simplicité d’usage, extensibilité, testabilité, cohérence UX, effort maintenance\n\n**2) Mode dégradé**\n- Options : fallback CSV obligatoire vs optionnel\n- Critères : robustesse IT, coût mapping, adoption user, risques d’erreur\n\n**3) Anonymisation**\n- Options : inline vs service dédié\n- Critères : performance locale, traçabilité, isolation des risques, facilité d’audit\n\n**4) Stockage local**\n- Options : cache minimal vs cache enrichi\n- Critères : vitesse, conformité purge, facilité replay, surface de risque\n\n**5) Templates**\n- Options : repo‑versionnés vs externes\n- Critères : gouvernance, acceptation client, facilité de mise à jour, auditabilité\n\n**6) Observabilité**\n- Options : logs locaux structurés vs centralisation\n- Critères : conformité IT, capacité de debug, effort d’implémentation\n\n### Cross‑Functional War Room (PM / Ingé / Design)\n\n- **PM (désirabilité & adoption)** : “Le run unique doit rester simple. Les options avancées doivent être cachées derrière `--advanced` pour éviter la surcharge. Le mode dégradé CSV doit être first‑class, sinon adoption faible en environnement restreint.”\n- **Ingénieur (faisabilité & robustesse)** : “Le cœur doit être un orchestrateur pipeline modulaire avec connecteurs isolés. Les intégrations doivent être remplaçables et testables. Les logs structurés sans données sensibles sont indispensables pour diagnostiquer sans risque.”\n- **Designer (expérience & clarté)** : “Le CLI doit maintenir la promesse ‘run → review → send’. Toute complexité doit apparaître seulement en cas d’erreur. Les templates doivent être gouvernés pour éviter la re‑saisie et les écarts de format.”\n\n\n## Starter Template Evaluation\n\n### Primary Technology Domain\n\nCLI tool (Rust) based on project requirements analysis\n\n### Starter Options Considered\n\n- rust-starter (cargo-generate): Rust CLI starter with clap, configuration, logging, and CI/release workflows.\n- Baseline: cargo new (minimal, manual setup).\n\n### Selected Starter: rust-starter\n\n**Rationale for Selection:**\nProvides a CLI-focused Rust base with common tooling and CI/release scaffolding, aligned with Windows/WSL support and future distribution needs.\n\n**Initialization Command:**\n\n```bash\ncargo generate --git https://github.com/rust-starter/rust-starter-generate\n```\n\n**Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter:**\n\n**Language & Runtime:**\nRust CLI binary\n\n**Styling Solution:**\nN/A (CLI)\n\n**Build Tooling:**\nCargo with starter CI/release workflows\n\n**Testing Framework:**\nCargo test defaults (can be extended later)\n\n**Code Organization:**\nCLI-oriented structure with clap and configuration/logging utilities\n\n**Development Experience:**\nTemplate-driven scaffolding with CI/release ready setup\n\n\n## Core Architectural Decisions\n\n### Decision Priority Analysis\n\n**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**\n- Stockage local principal en SQLite (version actuelle 3.51.1).\n- Cache enrichi sécurisé (chiffrement applicatif, TTL court, purge auto, replay explicite).\n- Validation stricte des données (reject + rapport d’erreurs).\n- Gestion des secrets via OS keyring (keyring crate 3.6.2).\n- Anonymisation inline obligatoire avant tout envoi cloud.\n- Logs structurés JSON sans données sensibles.\n\n**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**\n- Intégrations REST + mode dégradé CSV first-class.\n- Erreurs structurées (code + message + hint).\n- Retry exponentiel avec backoff.\n- Modèles internes typés + validation stricte.\n\n**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**\n- Aucun choix différé critique à ce stade.\n\n### Data Architecture\n\n- **Storage**: SQLite local (3.51.1)\n- **Cache**: enrichi, chiffré applicativement, TTL court, purge auto, replay explicite\n- **Validation**: stricte (reject + diagnostics)\n\n### Authentication & Security\n\n- **Secrets**: OS keyring (keyring 3.6.2)\n- **Chiffrement local**: chiffrement applicatif (pas de SQLCipher)\n- **Anonymisation**: pipeline inline obligatoire\n- **Logs**: JSON structurés sans PII\n\n### API & Communication Patterns\n\n- **Intégrations**: REST + fallback CSV obligatoire\n- **Erreurs**: structurées (code + message + hint)\n- **Retry**: exponentiel + backoff\n- **Contrats internes**: modèles typés + validation stricte\n\n### Frontend Architecture\n\n- N/A (CLI uniquement)\n\n### Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Distribution**: npm wrapper (téléchargement binaire par plateforme)\n- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions\n- **Versioning**: SemVer + changelog\n- **Observabilité**: logs JSON locaux + commande `tf diagnostics`\n\n### Technology Stack (Versions Exactes)\n\n**Runtime & Core:**\n- Rust edition: 2021 (MSRV 1.75+)\n- Async runtime: `tokio = \"1.41\"` (full features)\n- HTTP client: `reqwest = \"0.12\"` (rustls-tls, json)\n- CLI framework: `clap = \"4.5\"` (derive, env)\n- Serialization: `serde = \"1.0\"`, `serde_json = \"1.0\"`\n\n**Storage & Security:**\n- SQLite: `rusqlite = \"0.32\"` (bundled)\n- Secrets: `keyring = \"3.6\"`\n- Encryption: `aes-gcm = \"0.10\"` (chiffrement applicatif)\n- Hashing: `argon2 = \"0.5\"` (key derivation)\n\n**Logging & Diagnostics:**\n- Tracing: `tracing = \"0.1\"`, `tracing-subscriber = \"0.3\"` (json)\n- Error handling: `thiserror = \"2.0\"`, `anyhow = \"1.0\"`\n\n**Office & Export:**\n- Excel read: `calamine = \"0.26\"`\n- Excel write: `rust_xlsxwriter = \"0.79\"`\n- CSV: `csv = \"1.3\"`\n- Markdown: `pulldown-cmark = \"0.12\"`\n\n**Testing:**\n- Unit/Integration: `cargo test` (built-in)\n- Mocking: `mockall = \"0.13\"`\n- Assertions: `assert_cmd = \"2.0\"`, `predicates = \"3.1\"`\n\n### LLM Integration Architecture\n\n**Crate:** `tf-llm/`\n\n**Strategy:** LLM local prioritaire, cloud en fallback avec anonymisation obligatoire.\n\n**Local Runtime:**\n- Primary: Ollama via HTTP API (`http://localhost:11434`)\n- Fallback: llama.cpp binding si Ollama indisponible\n- Models recommandés: `mistral:7b-instruct`, `codellama:13b`\n\n**Cloud Fallback:**\n- OpenAI-compatible API (configurable endpoint)\n- Activation: uniquement si `config.llm.cloud_enabled = true`\n- Pré-requis: passage obligatoire par `tf-security/anonymize.rs`\n\n**Module Structure:**\n```\ntf-llm/\n├── Cargo.toml\n└── src/\n    ├── mod.rs\n    ├── local.rs       # Ollama/llama.cpp client\n    ├── cloud.rs       # OpenAI-compatible client\n    ├── orchestrator.rs # Routing local/cloud\n    ├── prompts.rs     # Prompt templates\n    └── types.rs       # Request/Response types\n```\n\n**Orchestration Flow:**\n1. `tf-core/pipeline` appelle `tf-llm/orchestrator`\n2. Orchestrator vérifie disponibilité LLM local\n3. Si local OK → appel direct\n4. Si local KO et cloud enabled → `tf-security/anonymize` → cloud\n5. Si local KO et cloud disabled → erreur avec hint \"Démarrer Ollama\"\n\n**Configuration:**\n```yaml\nllm:\n  local_endpoint: \"http://localhost:11434\"\n  local_model: \"mistral:7b-instruct\"\n  cloud_enabled: false\n  cloud_endpoint: \"https://api.openai.com/v1\"\n  cloud_model: \"gpt-4o-mini\"\n  timeout_seconds: 120\n  max_tokens: 4096\n```\n\n### Office Document Generation\n\n**Crate:** `tf-export/`\n\n**Strategy:** Génération native Excel, templates pour PowerPoint.\n\n**Module Structure:**\n```\ntf-export/\n├── Cargo.toml\n└── src/\n    ├── mod.rs\n    ├── excel.rs       # rust_xlsxwriter pour .xlsx\n    ├── ppt.rs         # Template OOXML pour .pptx\n    ├── markdown.rs    # Export .md\n    ├── html.rs        # Export .html\n    └── templates.rs   # Gestion des templates\n```\n\n**Excel Generation:**\n- Crate: `rust_xlsxwriter` (natif Rust, pas de dépendance Python)\n- Lecture existants: `calamine`\n- Formats: CR quotidien, exports données, matrices traçabilité\n\n**PowerPoint Generation:**\n- Approche: Template OOXML (fichier .pptx = archive ZIP avec XML)\n- Le système charge un template .pptx et remplace les placeholders\n- Templates stockés dans `assets/templates/*.pptx`\n- Limitation: pas de génération de slides complexes from scratch\n\n**Templates Location:**\n```\nassets/\n└── templates/\n    ├── cr-quotidien.xlsx\n    ├── ppt-hebdo.pptx\n    ├── ppt-tnr.pptx\n    └── anomalie.md\n```\n\n**Data Flow:**\n1. `tf-core/domain/report` prépare les données structurées\n2. `tf-export` charge le template approprié\n3. Injection des données dans le template\n4. Export vers le format cible\n\n### Decision Impact Analysis\n\n**Implementation Sequence:**\n1. Stockage local + chiffrement applicatif + purge/TTL\n2. Gestion des secrets (keyring) + anonymisation inline\n3. Connecteurs REST + fallback CSV + erreurs structurées\n4. **LLM local (Ollama) + orchestrator**\n5. **Export Office (Excel natif, PPT templates)**\n6. Observabilité + diagnostics\n7. Pipeline CI/CD + distribution npm wrapper\n\n**Cross-Component Dependencies:**\n- Cache enrichi ↔ chiffrement ↔ purge/TTL ↔ diagnostics\n- REST/CSV fallback ↔ erreurs structurées ↔ validation stricte\n- **LLM orchestrator ↔ tf-security/anonymize ↔ cloud fallback**\n- **tf-core/domain/report ↔ tf-export ↔ templates**\n\n\n## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules\n\n### Pattern Categories Defined\n\n**Critical Conflict Points Identified:**\nNaming, structure, formats, error handling, retry, logging, and diagnostics.\n\n### Naming Patterns\n\n**Code Naming Conventions:**\n- Files: `snake_case.rs`\n- Modules: `snake_case`\n- Struct/Enum: `PascalCase`\n- Functions/variables: `snake_case`\n- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`\n\n**Data/JSON Naming:**\n- JSON fields: `snake_case`\n- Dates: ISO-8601 UTC (`2026-01-30T12:34:56Z`)\n\n### Structure Patterns\n\n**Project Organization:**\n- `src/main.rs` entrypoint\n- `src/cli/` for CLI parsing & prompts\n- `src/commands/` for command handlers\n- `src/pipeline/` for orchestration flows\n- `src/connectors/` for Jira/Squash/SharePoint/CSV integrations\n- `src/domain/` for domain models\n- `src/storage/` for SQLite/cache\n- `src/security/` for anonymisation/secrets/redaction\n- `src/diagnostics/` for replay & debug\n- `src/errors/` for structured errors\n- `src/config/` for config/profiles\n- `src/logging/` for tracing setup\n- `tests/` for integration tests\n- `docs/` for CLI usage docs\n\n### Format Patterns\n\n**API/CLI Output:**\n- JSON envelope: `{ \"data\": ..., \"error\": null, \"meta\": {...} }`\n- Error object: `{ \"error\": { \"code\": \"...\", \"message\": \"...\", \"hint\": \"...\", \"details\": {...} } }`\n\n**Logging Format:**\n- JSON structured logs with fields: `timestamp`, `level`, `message`, `context`\n\n### Process Patterns\n\n**Exit Codes:**\n- 0 OK\n- 1 General error\n- 2 Validation error\n- 3 Integration error\n\n**Retry & Recovery:**\n- Exponential backoff, max 3 retries\n- Auto-fallback to CSV when API unavailable\n\n**Validation:**\n- Strict validation on load, reject + error report\n\n**Diagnostics:**\n- `tf diagnostics` produces a report with no PII\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\n**All AI Agents MUST:**\n- Follow naming conventions for Rust & JSON\n- Place code in the agreed directories\n- Use structured errors + JSON logs\n- Respect exit codes and retry policies\n\n**Pattern Enforcement:**\n- Lint + CI checks for structure and naming\n- Review checklist includes pattern compliance\n- Any exceptions documented in `docs/pattern-exceptions.md`\n\n### Pattern Examples\n\n**Good Examples:**\n- `src/connectors/jira_client.rs`\n- JSON error: `{ \"error\": { \"code\": \"JIRA_AUTH\", \"message\": \"Invalid token\", \"hint\": \"Re-login\", \"details\": {\"status\": 401} } }`\n\n**Anti-Patterns:**\n- CamelCase file names (`JiraClient.rs`)\n- Logs with raw PII\n- Ad-hoc folder creation (`src/utils2/`)\n\n\n##

only\n- External APIs via `tf-connectors`\n- Data access in `tf-storage`\n\n**Component Boundaries:**\n- Pipeline orchestration in `tf-core`\n- Security/anonymisation in `tf-security`\n- Diagnostics isolated in `tf-diagnostics`\n- LLM orchestration in `tf-llm`\n- Document generation in `tf-export`\n\n**Service Boundaries:**\n- Connectors are the only modules that call external services (Jira, Squash, SharePoint)\n- `tf-llm` calls LLM services (local Ollama or cloud API)\n- Core pipeline is pure business logic\n\n**Data Boundaries:**\n- SQLite cache access only in `tf-storage`\n- Domain models live in `tf-core`\n\n### Requirements to Structure Mapping\n\n**FR Categories → Modules:**\n- Ingestion/Triage → `tf-connectors`, `tf-core/pipeline`, `tf-cli/commands/triage.rs`\n- Test Design → `tf-core/domain` + `tf-llm` (génération assistée) + CLI commands\n- Execution/Evidence → `tf-connectors` + `tf-core/pipeline`\n- Anomaly Mgmt → `tf-core/domain` + `tf-llm` (génération brouillons) + `tf-cli/commands/anomalies.rs`\n- Reporting → `tf-core/domain/report` + `tf-export` (Excel/PPT) + `tf-cli/commands/report.rs`\n- Config/Reuse → `tf-config`\n- Compliance/Safety → `tf-security`, `tf-logging`, `tf-diagnostics`\n- LLM Integration → `tf-llm` (local prioritaire, cloud fallback avec anonymisation via `tf-security`)\n\n### Integration Points\n\n**Internal Communication:**\n- `tf-cli` → `tf-core` orchestrates\n- `tf-core` → `tf-connectors` for external data\n- `tf-core` → `tf-storage` for cache\n- `tf-core` → `tf-security` for anonymisation\n- `tf-core` → `tf-llm` for AI-assisted generation\n- `tf-core` → `tf-export` for document generation\n- `tf-llm` → `tf-security` for anonymisation before cloud calls\n\n**External Integrations:**\n- Jira/Squash/SharePoint via `tf-connectors`\n- CSV import/export via `tf-connectors/csv.rs`\n- LLM local (Ollama) via `tf-llm/local.rs`\n- LLM cloud (OpenAI-compatible) via `tf-llm/cloud.rs`\n\n**Data Flow:**\nCLI → Core Pipeline → Connectors/Storage → LLM (optional) → Export → Domain Outputs → CLI Output\n\n### File Organization Patterns\n\n**Configuration Files:**\n- `.env.example` at root\n- `config.yaml` loaded via `tf-config`\n\n**Source Organization:**\n- crate boundaries define ownership\n\n**Test Organization:**\n- integration tests in `tests/integration`\n\n**Asset Organization:**\n- `assets/templates/` for Office templates (xlsx, pptx, md)\n- Templates are versioned with the codebase\n- User-customizable templates can override defaults via config\n\n### Development Workflow Integration\n\n**Development Server Structure:**\n- N/A (CLI)\n\n**Build Process Structure:**\n- Workspace builds all crates; `tf-cli` produces final binary\n\n**Deployment Structure:**\n- CI builds `tf-cli` per OS; npm wrapper downloads binaries\n\n\n## Architecture Validation Results\n\n### Coherence Validation ✅\n\n**Decision Compatibility:**\nLes choix sont compatibles : Rust CLI + workspace, SQLite local chiffré applicativement, secrets via keyring, logs JSON, intégrations REST + fallback CSV, CI GitHub Actions, distribution npm wrapper.\n\n**Pattern Consistency:**\nLes conventions de nommage/structure/format/logs sont alignées avec la stack Rust et les exigences de conformité.\n\n**Structure Alignment:**\nLa structure multi-crates isole bien connecteurs, sécurité, stockage, diagnostics et CLI, réduisant les conflits entre agents.\n\n### Requirements Coverage Validation ✅\n\n**Epic/Feature Coverage:**\nN/A (pas d'epics, mapping par catégories FR).\n\n**Functional Requirements Coverage:**\nToutes les catégories FR sont couvertes : ingestion/triage, génération, exécution, anomalies, reporting, config et réutilisation.\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements Coverage:**\nPrivacy/anonymisation, secret store, least privilege, audit logs, purge locale, performance CLI, mode dégradé, fiabilité/replay sont tous adressés.\n\n### Implementation Readiness Validation ✅\n\n**Decision Completeness:**\nDécisions critiques documentées avec versions (SQLite 3.51.1, keyring 3.6.2).\n\n**Structure Completeness:**\nArborescence complète multi-crates + tests + docs.\n\n**Pattern Completeness:**\nNommage, structure, formats, erreurs, retry, logs, diagnostics sont définis.\n\n### Gap Analysis Results\n\n- **Critical gaps:** none (LLM architecture et Office generation ajoutés)\n- **Important gaps:** none (Technology stack avec versions exactes documenté)\n- **Nice-to-have:** documenter ultérieurement la politique exacte de TTL/purge et le format du rapport diagnostics.\n\n### Validation Issues Addressed\n\nAucun point bloquant détecté.\n\n### Architecture Completeness Checklist\n\n**✅ Requirements Analysis**\n\n- [x] Project context thoroughly analyzed\n- [x] Scale and complexity assessed\n- [x] Technical constraints identified\n- [x] Cross-cutting concerns mapped\n\n**✅ Architectural Decisions**\n\n- [x] Critical decisions documented with versions\n- [x] Technology stack fully specified\n- [x] Integration patterns defined\n- [x] Performance considerations addressed\n\n**✅ Implementation Patterns**\n\n- [x] Naming conventions established\n- [x] Structure patterns defined\n- [x] Communication patterns specified\n- [x] Process patterns documented\n\n**✅ Project Structure**\n\n- [x] Complete directory structure defined\n- [x] Component boundaries established\n- [x] Integration points mapped\n- [x] Requirements to structure mapping complete\n\n### Architecture Readiness Assessment\n\n**Overall Status:** READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION  \n**Confidence Level:** high\n\n**Key Strengths:**\n- Séparation claire des responsabilités (core/connectors/security/storage)\n- Conformité privacy/LLM local by design\n- Mode dégradé robuste via CSV\n\n**Areas for Future Enhancement:**\n- Spécifier TTL/purge exacts\n- Définir le format final du rapport diagnostics\n\n### Implementation Handoff\n\n**AI Agent Guidelines:**\n- Follow all architectural decisions exactly as documented\n- Use implementation patterns consistently across all components\n- Respect project structure and boundaries\n- Refer to this document for all architectural questions\n\n**First Implementation Priority:**\nInitialiser le workspace via le starter `rust-starter` puis poser les crates (`tf-cli`, `tf-core`, `tf-connectors`, `tf-storage`, `tf-security`, `tf-config`, `tf-logging`, `tf-diagnostics`, `tf-llm`, `tf-export`).\n\n**Crate Dependencies (ordre d'implémentation recommandé):**\n1. `tf-config` (aucune dépendance interne)\n2. `tf-logging` (dépend de tf-config)\n3. `tf-security` (dépend de tf-config)\n4. `tf-storage` (dépend de tf-config, tf-security)\n5. `tf-connectors` (dépend de tf-config, tf-storage)\n6. `tf-llm` (dépend de tf-config, tf-security)\n7. `tf-export` (dépend de tf-config)\n8. `tf-core` (dépend de tous les crates ci-dessus)\n9. `tf-diagnostics` (dépend de tf-config, tf-logging, tf-storage)\n10.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Analyze Current Document State\n\nRead the existing architecture document completely and analyze:\n\n**Frontmatter Analysis:**\n\n- `stepsCompleted`: What steps have been done\n- `inputDocuments`: What documents were loaded\n- `lastStep`: Last step that was executed\n- `project_name`, `user_name`, `date`: Basic context\n\n**Content Analysis:**\n\n- What sections exist in the document\n- What architectural decisions have been made\n- What appears incomplete or in progress\n- Any TODOs or placeholders remaining\n\n### 2. Present Continuation Summary\n\nShow the user their current progress:\n\n\"Welcome back {{user_name}}! I found your Architecture work for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Current Progress:**\n\n- Steps completed: {{stepsCompleted list}}\n- Last step worked on: Step {{lastStep}}\n- Input documents loaded: {{number of inputDocuments}} files\n\n**Document Sections Found:**\n{list all H2/H3 sections found in the document}\n\n{if_incomplete_sections}\n**Incomplete Areas:**\n\n- {areas that appear incomplete or have placeholders}\n  {/if_incomplete_sections}\n\n**What would you like to do?**\n[R] Resume from where we left off\n[C] Continue to next logical step\n[O] Overview of all remaining steps\n[X] Start over (will overwrite existing work)\n\"\n\n### 3. Handle User Choice\n\n#### If 'R' (Resume from where we left off):\n\n- Identify the next step based on `stepsCompleted`\n- Load the appropriate step file to continue\n- Example: If `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3]`, load `step-04-decisions.md`\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue to next logical step):\n\n- Analyze the document content to determine logical next step\n- May need to review content quality and completeness\n- If content seems complete for current step, advance to next\n- If content seems incomplete, suggest staying on current step\n\n#### If 'O' (Overview of all remaining steps):\n\n- Provide brief description of all remaining steps\n- Let user choose which step to work on\n- Don't assume sequential progression is always best\n\n#### If 'X' (Start over):\n\n- Confirm: \"This will delete all existing architectural decisions. Are you sure? (y/n)\"\n- If confirmed: Delete existing document and return to step-01-init.md\n- If not confirmed: Return to continuation menu\n\n### 4. Navigate to Selected Step\n\nAfter user makes choice:\n\n**Load the selected step file:**\n\n- Update frontmatter `lastStep` to reflect current navigation\n- Execute the selected step file\n- Let that step handle the detailed continuation logic\n\n**State Preservation:**\n\n- Maintain all existing content in the document\n- Keep `stepsCompleted` accurate\n- Track the resumption in workflow status\n\n### 5. Special Continuation Cases\n\n#### If `stepsCompleted` is empty but document has content:\n\n- This suggests an interrupted workflow\n- Ask user: \"I see the document has content but no steps are marked as complete. Should I analyze what's here and set the appropriate step status?\"\n\n#### If document appears corrupted or incomplete:\n\n- Ask user: \"The document seems incomplete. Would you like me to try to recover what's here, or would you prefer to start fresh?\"\n\n#### If document is complete but workflow not marked as done:\n\n- Ask user: \"The architecture looks complete! Should I mark this workflow as finished, or is there more you'd like to work on?\"\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Existing document state properly analyzed and understood\n✅ User presented with clear continuation options\n✅ User choice handled appropriately and transparently\n✅ Workflow state preserved and updated correctly\n✅ Navigation to appropriate step handled smoothly\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Not reading the complete existing document before making suggestions\n❌ Losing track of what steps were actually completed\n❌ Automatically proceeding without user confirmation of next steps\n❌ Not checking for incomplete or placeholder content\n❌ Losing existing document content during resumption\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects their continuation option, load the appropriate step file based on their choice. The step file will handle the detailed work from that point forward.\n\nRemember: The goal is smooth, transparent resumption that respects the work already done while giving the user control over how to proceed.\n"}}

Check Technical Preferences & Context\n\n**Check Project Context for Existing Technical Preferences:**\n\"Before we dive into starter templates, let me check if you have any technical preferences already documented.\n\n{{if_project_context_exists}}\nI found some technical rules in your project context file:\n{{extracted_technical_preferences_from_project_context}}\n\n**Project Context Technical Rules Found:**\n\n- Languages/Frameworks: {{languages_frameworks_from_context}}\n- Tools & Libraries: {{tools_from_context}}\n- Development Patterns: {{patterns_from_context}}\n- Platform Preferences: {{platforms_from_context}}\n\n{{else}}\nNo existing technical preferences found in project context file. We'll establish your technical preferences now.\n{{/if_project_context}}\"\n\n**Discover User Technical Preferences:**\n\"Based on your project context, let's discuss your technical preferences:\n\n{{primary_technology_category}} Preferences:\n\n- **Languages**: Do you have preferences between TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, etc.?\n- **Frameworks**: Any existing familiarity or preferences (React, Vue, Angular, Next.js, etc.)?\n- **Databases**: Any preferences or existing infrastructure (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, etc.)?\n\n**Development Experience:**\n\n- What's your team's experience level with different technologies?\n- Are there any technologies you want to learn vs. what you're comfortable with?\n\n**Platform/Deployment Preferences:**\n\n- Cloud provider preferences (AWS, Vercel, Railway, etc.)?\n- Container preferences (Docker, Serverless, Traditional)?\n\n**Integrations:**\n\n- Any existing systems or APIs you need to integrate with?\n- Third-party services you plan to use (payment, authentication, analytics, etc.)?\n\nThese preferences will help me recommend the most suitable starter templates and guide our architectural decisions.\"\n\n### 1. Identify Primary Technology Domain\n\nBased on project context analysis and technical preferences, identify the primary technology stack:\n\n- **Web application** → Look for Next.js, Vite, Remix, SvelteKit starters\n- **Mobile app** → Look for React Native, Expo, Flutter starters\n- **API/Backend** → Look for NestJS, Express, Fastify, Supabase starters\n- **CLI tool** → Look for CLI framework starters (oclif, commander, etc.)\n- **Full-stack** → Look for T3, RedwoodJS, Blitz, Next.js starters\n- **Desktop** → Look for Electron, Tauri starters\n\n### 2. UX Requirements Consideration\n\nIf UX specification was loaded, consider UX requirements when selecting starter:\n\n- **Rich animations** → Framer Motion compatible starter\n- **Complex forms** → React Hook Form included starter\n- **Real-time features** → Socket.io or WebSocket ready starter\n- **Design system** → Storybook-enabled starter\n- **Offline capability** → Service worker or PWA configured starter\n\n### 3. Research Current Starter Options\n\nSearch the web to find current, maintained starter templates:\n\n```\nSearch the web: \"{{primary_technology}} starter template CLI create command latest\"\nSearch the web: \"{{primary_technology}} boilerplate generator latest options\"\nSearch the web: \"{{primary_technology}} production-ready starter best practices\"\n```\n\n### 4. Investigate Top Starter Options\n\nFor each promising starter found, investigate details:\n\n```\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} default setup technologies included latest\"\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} project structure file organization\"\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} production deployment capabilities\"\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} recent updates maintenance status\"\n```\n\n### 5. Analyze What Each Starter Provides\n\nFor each viable starter option, document:\n\n**Technology Decisions Made:**\n\n- Language/TypeScript configuration\n- Styling solution (CSS, Tailwind, Styled Components, etc.)\n- Testing framework setup\n- Linting/Formatting configuration\n- Build tooling and optimization\n- Project structure and organization\n\n**Architectural Patterns Established:**\n\n- Code organization patterns\n- Component structure conventions\n- API layering approach\n- State management setup\n- Routing patterns\n- Environment configuration\n\n**Development Experience Features:**\n\n- Hot reloading and development server\n- TypeScript configuration\n- Debugging setup\n- Testing infrastructure\n- Documentation generation\n\n### 6. Present Starter Options\n\nBased on user skill level and project needs:\n\n**For Expert Users:**\n\"Found {{starter_name}} which provides:\n{{quick_decision_list_of_key_decisions}}\n\nThis would establish our base architecture with these technical decisions already made. Use it?\"\n\n**For Intermediate Users:**\n\"I found {{starter_name}}, which is a well-maintained starter for {{project_type}} projects.\n\nIt makes these architectural decisions for us:\n{{decision_list_with_explanations}}\n\nThis gives us a solid foundation following current best practices. Should we use it?\"\n\n**For Beginner Users:**\n\"I found {{starter_name}}, which is like a pre-built foundation for your project.\n\nThink of it like buying a prefab house frame instead of cutting each board yourself.\n\nIt makes these decisions for us:\n{{friendly_explanation_of_decisions}}\n\nThis is a great starting point that follows best practices and saves us from making dozens of small technical choices. Should we use it?\"\n\n### 7. Get Current CLI Commands\n\nIf user shows interest in a starter, get the exact current commands:\n\n```\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} CLI command options flags latest\"\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} create new project command examples\"\n```\n\n### 8.

Coherence Validation\n\nCheck that all architectural decisions work together:\n\n**Decision Compatibility:**\n\n- Do all technology choices work together without conflicts?\n- Are all versions compatible with each other?\n- Do patterns align with technology choices?\n- Are there any contradictory decisions?\n\n**Pattern Consistency:**\n\n- Do implementation patterns support the architectural decisions?\n- Are naming conventions consistent across all areas?\n- Do structure patterns align with technology stack?\n- Are communication patterns coherent?\n\n**Structure Alignment:**\n\n- Does the project structure support all architectural decisions?\n- Are boundaries properly defined and respected?\n- Does the structure enable the chosen patterns?\n- Are integration points properly structured?\n\n### 2. Requirements Coverage Validation\n\nVerify all project requirements are architecturally supported:\n\n**From Epics (if available):**\n\n- Does every epic have architectural support?\n- Are all user stories implementable with these decisions?\n- Are cross-epic dependencies handled architecturally?\n- Are there any gaps in epic coverage?\n\n**From FR Categories (if no epics):**\n\n- Does every functional requirement have architectural support?\n- Are all FR categories fully covered by architectural decisions?\n- Are cross-cutting FRs properly addressed?\n- Are there any missing architectural capabilities?\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\n\n- Are performance requirements addressed architecturally?\n- Are security requirements fully covered?\n- Are scalability considerations properly handled?\n- Are compliance requirements architecturally supported?\n\n### 3. Implementation Readiness Validation\n\nAssess if AI agents can implement consistently:\n\n**Decision Completeness:**\n\n- Are all critical decisions documented with versions?\n- Are implementation patterns comprehensive enough?\n- Are consistency rules clear and enforceable?\n- Are examples provided for all major patterns?\n\n**Structure Completeness:**\n\n- Is the project structure complete and specific?\n- Are all files and directories defined?\n- Are integration points clearly specified?\n- Are component boundaries well-defined?\n\n**Pattern Completeness:**\n\n- Are all potential conflict points addressed?\n- Are naming conventions comprehensive?\n- Are communication patterns fully specified?\n- Are process patterns (error handling, etc.) complete?\n\n### 4. Gap Analysis\n\nIdentify and document any missing elements:\n\n**Critical Gaps:**\n\n- Missing architectural decisions that block implementation\n- Incomplete patterns that could cause conflicts\n- Missing structural elements needed for development\n- Undefined integration points\n\n**Important Gaps:**\n\n- Areas that need more detailed specification\n- Patterns that could be more comprehensive\n- Documentation that would help implementation\n- Examples that would clarify complex decisions\n\n**Nice-to-Have Gaps:**\n\n- Additional patterns that would be helpful\n- Supplementary documentation\n- Tooling recommendations\n- Development workflow optimizations\n\n### 5.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Uses adversarial review approach to find gaps and issues.'\nweb_bundle: false\n---\n\n# Implementation Readiness\n\n**Goal:** Validate that PRD, Architecture, Epics and Stories are complete and aligned before Phase 4 implementation starts, with a focus on ensuring epics and stories are logical and have accounted for all requirements and planning.\n\n**Your Role:** You are an expert Product Manager and Scrum Master, renowned and respected in the field of requirements traceability and spotting gaps in planning. Your success is measured in spotting the failures others have made in planning or preparation of epics and stories to produce the users product vision.\n\n## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE\n\n### Core Principles\n\n- **Micro-file Design**: Each step of the overall goal is a self contained instruction file that you will adhere too 1 file as directed at a time\n- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only 1 current step file will be loaded and followed to completion - never load future step files until told to do so\n- **Sequential Enforcement**: Sequence within the step files must be completed in order, no skipping or optimization allowed\n- **State Tracking**: Document progress in output file frontmatter using `stepsCompleted` array when a workflow produces a document\n- **Append-Only Building**: Build documents by appending content as directed to the output file\n\n### Step Processing Rules\n\n1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action\n2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all numbered sections in order, never deviate\n3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: If a menu is presented, halt and wait for user selection\n4. **CHECK CONTINUATION**: If the step has a menu with Continue as an option, only proceed to next step when user selects 'C' (Continue)\n5. **SAVE STATE**: Update `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter before loading next step\n6. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, read fully and follow the next step file\n\n### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)\n\n- 🛑 **NEVER** load multiple step files simultaneously\n- 📖 **ALWAYS** read entire step file before execution\n- 🚫 **NEVER** skip steps or optimize the sequence\n- 💾 **ALWAYS** update frontmatter of output files when writing the final output for a specific step\n- 🎯 **ALWAYS** follow the exact instructions in the step file\n- ⏸️ **ALWAYS** halt at menus and wait for user input\n- 📋 **NEVER** create mental todo lists from future steps\n\n---\n\n## INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE\n\n### 1. Module Configuration Loading\n\nLoad and read full config from {project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml and resolve:\n\n- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `planning_artifacts`, `user_name`, `communication_language`, `document_output_language`\n- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`\n\n### 2. First Step EXECUTION\n\nRead fully and follow: `./step-01-document-discovery.md` to begin the workflow.\n"}}

Initialize Document Discovery\n\n\"Beginning **Document Discovery** to inventory all project files.\n\nI will:\n\n1. Search for all required documents (PRD, Architecture, Epics, UX)\n2. Group sharded documents together\n3. Identify any duplicates (whole + sharded versions)\n4. Present findings for your confirmation\"\n\n### 2. Document Search Patterns\n\nSearch for each document type using these patterns:\n\n#### A. PRD Documents\n\n- Whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*prd*.md`\n- Sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*prd*/index.md` and related files\n\n#### B. Architecture Documents\n\n- Whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*.md`\n- Sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*architecture*/index.md` and related files\n\n#### C. Epics & Stories Documents\n\n- Whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*.md`\n- Sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*/index.md` and related files\n\n#### D. UX Design Documents\n\n- Whole: `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*.md`\n- Sharded: `{planning_artifacts}/*ux*/index.md` and related files\n\n### 3. Organize Findings\n\nFor each document type found:\n\n```\n## [Document Type] Files Found\n\n**Whole Documents:**\n- [filename.md] ([size], [modified date])\n\n**Sharded Documents:**\n- Folder: [foldername]/\n  - index.md\n  - [other files in folder]\n```\n\n### 4. Identify Critical Issues\n\n#### Duplicates (CRITICAL)\n\nIf both whole and sharded versions exist:\n\n```\n⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE: Duplicate document formats found\n- PRD exists as both whole.md AND prd/ folder\n- YOU MUST choose which version to use\n- Remove or rename the other version to avoid confusion\n```\n\n#### Missing Documents (WARNING)\n\nIf required documents not found:\n\n```\n⚠️ WARNING: Required document not found\n- Architecture document not found\n- Will impact assessment completeness\n```\n\n### 5. Add Initial Report Section\n\nInitialize {outputFile} with {templateFile}.\n\n### 6. Present Findings and Get Confirmation\n\nDisplay findings and ask:\n\"**Document Discovery Complete**\n\n[Show organized file list]\n\n**Issues Found:**\n\n- [List any duplicates requiring resolution]\n- [List any missing documents]\n\n**Required Actions:**\n\n- If duplicates exist: Please remove/rename one version\n- Confirm which documents to use for assessment\n\n**Ready to proceed?** [C] Continue after resolving issues\"\n\n### 7. Present MENU OPTIONS\n\nDisplay: **Select an Option:** [C] Continue to File Validation\n\n#### EXECUTION RULES:\n\n- ALWAYS halt and wait for user input after presenting menu\n- ONLY proceed with 'C' selection\n- If duplicates identified, insist on resolution first\n- User can clarify file locations or request additional searches\n\n#### Menu Handling Logic:\n\n- IF C: Save document inventory to {outputFile}, update frontmatter with completed step and files being included, and then read fully and follow: {nextStepFile}\n- IF Any other comments or queries: help user respond then redisplay menu\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nONLY WHEN C is selected and document inventory is saved will you load {nextStepFile} to begin file validation.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- All document types searched systematically\n- Files organized and inventoried clearly\n- Duplicates identified and flagged for resolution\n- User confirmed file selections\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not searching all document types\n- Ignoring duplicate document conflicts\n- Proceeding without resolving critical issues\n- Not saving document inventory\n\n**Master Rule:** Clear file identification is essential for accurate assessment.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Initialize PRD Analysis\n\n\"Beginning **PRD Analysis** to extract all requirements.\n\nI will:\n\n1. Load the PRD document (whole or sharded)\n2. Read it completely and thoroughly\n3. Extract ALL Functional Requirements (FRs)\n4. Extract ALL Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)\n5. Document findings for coverage validation\"\n\n### 2. Load and Read PRD\n\nFrom the document inventory in step 1:\n\n- If whole PRD file exists: Load and read it completely\n- If sharded PRD exists: Load and read ALL files in the PRD folder\n- Ensure complete coverage - no files skipped\n\n### 3. Extract Functional Requirements (FRs)\n\nSearch for and extract:\n\n- Numbered FRs (FR1, FR2, FR3, etc.)\n- Requirements labeled \"Functional Requirement\"\n- User stories or use cases that represent functional needs\n- Business rules that must be implemented\n\nFormat findings as:\n\n```\n## Functional Requirements Extracted\n\nFR1: [Complete requirement text]\nFR2: [Complete requirement text]\nFR3: [Complete requirement text]\n...\nTotal FRs: [count]\n```\n\n### 4. Extract Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)\n\nSearch for and extract:\n\n- Performance requirements (response times, throughput)\n- Security requirements (authentication, encryption, etc.)\n- Usability requirements (accessibility, ease of use)\n- Reliability requirements (uptime, error rates)\n- Scalability requirements (concurrent users, data growth)\n- Compliance requirements (standards, regulations)\n\nFormat findings as:\n\n```\n## Non-Functional Requirements Extracted\n\nNFR1: [Performance requirement]\nNFR2: [Security requirement]\nNFR3: [Usability requirement]\n...\nTotal NFRs: [count]\n```\n\n### 5. Document Additional Requirements\n\nLook for:\n\n- Constraints or assumptions\n- Technical requirements not labeled as FR/NFR\n- Business constraints\n- Integration requirements\n\n### 6. Add to Assessment Report\n\nAppend to {outputFile}:\n\n```markdown\n## PRD Analysis\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n[Complete FR list from section 3]\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n\n[Complete NFR list from section 4]\n\n### Additional Requirements\n\n[Any other requirements or constraints found]\n\n### PRD Completeness Assessment\n\n[Initial assessment of PRD completeness and clarity]\n```\n\n### 7. Auto-Proceed to Next Step\n\nAfter PRD analysis complete, immediately load next step for epic coverage validation.\n\n## PROCEEDING TO EPIC COVERAGE VALIDATION\n\nPRD analysis complete. Loading next step to validate epic coverage.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- PRD loaded and read completely\n- All FRs extracted with full text\n- All NFRs identified and documented\n- Findings added to assessment report\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Not reading complete PRD (especially sharded versions)\n- Missing requirements in extraction\n- Summarizing instead of extracting full text\n- Not documenting findings in report\n\n**Master Rule:** Complete requirement extraction is essential for traceability validation.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Les emails sont tries rapidement, puis le weekly TRA aligne les priorites. Le planning mensuel te donne une trajectoire claire.\nEn phase devis, les tickets Jira passent par une checklist testabilite : ceux qui ne sont pas \"ready\" sont immediatement identifies. Un pipeline d'aide propose une extraction d'exigences et une strategie de tests structuree, que tu ajustes.\nEn conception, Squash est alimente par des propositions de cas de test pretes a relire, avec la checklist ESN integree.\nEn execution, tu lances la campagne ; les preuves video sont centralisees automatiquement et liees aux cas. Les anomalies se generent avec un template structure, preuves liees, et l'association Squash <-> Jira est fluide.\nEn fin de journee, le CR quotidien est pre-rempli (extraction Jira/Squash/Outlook), tu corriges et envoies en 5 minutes.\nLe mercredi, le PPT hebdo est pre-genere a partir des sources, tu ajustes les priorites et l'envoies.\nResultat : un rythme maitrise, une qualite percue superieure, et un effort mental reduit.\n\n### Journey 2 - Primary User - Edge Case \"jour qui deborde\"\nLe weekly deborde, les tickets sont volumineux et mal cadres. Tu risques la dispersion.\nLe systeme te ramene a un cadre industriel : tri automatique des tickets, alertes sur manque d'infos, actions proposees (clarification, demande MOA, report).\nIl suit la consommation de charge vs prevision, t'alerte avant la derive, et propose un plan de rattrapage (priorite, suspension, decalage).\nEn fin de journee, meme si tout part en vrille, le CR pre-rempli securise le rituel, evite le \"non-envoi\".\nResultat : tu gardes le controle, meme dans le chaos.\n\n### Journey 3 - Admin/Ops (toi) - Configuration et gouvernance\nTu ajustes les templates (anomalies, CR, PPT), les regles de checklist, les seuils KPI, et les sources de verite.\nTu ajoutes un nouveau perimetre, tu declares ses regles de nommage, et tu reutilises le pipeline existant.\nResultat : l'outillage est modulaire, maintenable, reutilisable.\n\n### Journey 4 - Support/Qualite - Investigation d'erreurs\nUne extraction ne colle pas. Tu consultes les logs de pipeline (quelle source, quelle transformation, quel mapping) et tu corriges.\nTu peux rejouer une extraction en mode diagnostic.\nResultat : transparence, fiabilite, et reduction des erreurs silencieuses.\n\n### Journey 5 - Reutilisation/Integration - Un autre projet branche la logique\nUn futur testeur clone le workflow, charge ses propres sources (Jira/Squash) et ses templates.\nLes modules sont interchangeables (reporting, checklist, anomalies, generation).\nResultat : transfert rapide, industrialisation multi-projets.\n\n### Journey 6 - TNR - Phase critique GO/NO-GO\nEn fin de lot, la campagne TNR est copiee et structuree automatiquement.\nLes anomalies TNR sont taguees, les preuves sont centralisees, et le PPT TNR est pre-rempli (GO/NO-GO, reserves, liens).\nResultat : decision finale plus fiable, moins de stress.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n- Pipeline d'extraction Jira/Squash/Outlook/Excel/PPT -> pre-remplissage CR et PPT\n- Checklist testabilite + scoring Go / Clarify / No-Go\n- Generation de brouillons (cas de tests, anomalies) avec LLM local\n- Tracabilite complete preuves <-> cas <-> anomalies <-> tickets\n- Modules reutilisables + configuration par projet\n- Logs/diagnostics et mode replay\n- Gestion charge vs prevision + alertes\n- Support TNR (campagne, tags, reporting GO/NO-GO)\n\n## Domain-Specific Requirements\n\n### Compliance & Regulatory\n- Usage IA sensible : LLM local prioritaire, cloud possible mais jamais sans anonymisation automatique.\n- Mecanisme d'anonymisation by design avant tout envoi vers un LLM cloud.\n- Aucune donnee sensible (clients finaux) ne doit sortir du perimetre sans masquage.\n\n### Regulatory Requirements (Assurance)\n- Conformite aux exigences assurance par juridiction (a confirmer avec le client).\n- Respect des politiques internes de conservation des preuves et livrables (duree, lieu, acces).\n- Journalisation minimale pour audit interne (qui, quand, quoi) sans donnees sensibles.\n\n### Risk Modeling (Assurance)\n- Hors scope du MVP : aucune decision actuarielle ni modele de risque automatique.\n- Si des indicateurs de risque sont ajoutes plus tard, ils doivent etre explicitement valides par le client.\n\n### Fraud Detection\n- Hors scope du MVP : aucune detection de fraude automatique.\n- Possibilite future de signaler des anomalies suspectes via tags standardises (sans decision automatique).\n\n### Reporting Compliance\n- Conformite aux formats de reporting attendus par le client (PPT, CR, TNR).\n- Traçabilite des rapports via stockage SharePoint et references Jira/Squash.\n\n### Technical Constraints\n- Jira : API token OK (hors VM).\n- Squash : Basic auth au depart (token a demander).\n- Least privilege : demarrage read-only, ecriture apres validation.\n- Secrets dans un coffre/secret store, jamais en clair.\n- HTTPS/TLS pour API ; Squash en HTTP probable (a faire evoluer).\n- Stockage au repos sur SharePoint ; donnees locales minimisees, chiffrees, purges.\n- Audit logs minimaux : horodatage, perimetre, version, statut, sans donnees sensibles.\n- Restrictions IT a confirmer : scripts signes/macros, droits install, proxy, appels externes.\n- Execution idealement sur environnement approuve (poste + M365), VM reservee aux applis testees.\n\n### Integration Requirements\n- Critiques : Jira + Squash (sources de verite), SharePoint (preuves/livrables), Excel & PowerPoint (CR + reporting).\n- Souhaitees : Outlook + Teams pour diffusion et recuperation d'infos reunions.\n- Jira : API OK, tokens OK.\n- Squash : API OK en Basic, token non dispo immediatement.\n\n### Risk Mitigations\n- Squash token manquant : demarrage en Basic, plan d'evolution.\n- Outlook/Teams API possiblement restreints : risque sur automatisation diffusion.\n- Cloud LLM : risque privacy -> anonymisation automatique + option LLM local.\n\n## Innovation & Novel Patterns\n\n### Detected Innovation Areas\n- Exploitation des preuves video pour detecter des ecarts avec les cas de test et proposer des ameliorations de redaction (priorite d'innovation).\n- LLM local integre au workflow : CLI conversationnel + etapes automatiques dans le pipeline selon le contexte.\n- Pipeline d'industrialisation reutilisable multi-projets (modules interchangeables).\n\n### Market Context & Competitive Landscape\n- Innovation interne : peu d'outillage TRA combine Jira/Squash/SharePoint et IA locale de maniere integree.\n- Differenciation via l'usage des preuves video pour ameliorer la qualite des cas de test.\n\n### Validation Approach\n- Prouver la valeur sur un lot pilote : reduction des erreurs de reporting et gain de temps sans perte de qualite.\n- Valider l'assistant LLM local sur un sous-ensemble de tickets et cas de test, avec relecture humaine obligatoire.\n- Valider la detection d'ecarts via preuves video sur un echantillon limite avant generalisation.\n\n### Risk Mitigation\n- Si l'IA video est trop complexe : fallback sur pipeline d'amelioration manuelle assistee.\n- Si l'IA locale est insuffisante : option cloud avec anonymisation automatique.\n- Si resistance au changement : activer en mode opt-in et comparer performances avant/apres.\n\n## CLI Tool Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n- Outil CLI interactif et scriptable, destine a industrialiser les flux QA (reporting, checklist, generation de brouillons).\n- Usage multi-projets avec profils et configuration reutilisable.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n- Modes d'execution : assistant interactif + batch/script.\n- Sorties multi-formats : texte, JSON, CSV, Markdown, HTML, YAML.\n- Separation stricte des secrets via secret store / env vars.\n\n### Command Structure\n- Commandes principales orientees workflow (triage, design, execute, report, tnr).\n- Sous-commandes pour extraction, generation, publication, diagnostics.\n\n### Output Formats\n- Selection via flag (--format

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

L’utilisateur n’a plus qu’à relire et ajuster rapidement.\n\n### Platform Strategy\n\nUX CLI uniquement, avec un mode interactif guidé et un mode batch pour les usages récurrents. Prévoir un mode dégradé lorsque les APIs ne sont pas disponibles (fallback via imports/exports CSV).\n\n### Effortless Interactions\n\n- Pré‑remplissage automatique des templates (CR, anomalies).\n- Checklist de testabilité simple avec score instantané Go/Clarify/No‑Go.\n- Liaison automatique preuves ↔ tickets ↔ anomalies.\n\n### Critical Success Moments\n\n- Pré-remplissage automatique du CR < 2 minutes (partie système).\n- Le CR est généré et prêt en moins de 5 minutes, avec un haut niveau de confiance.\n- Un ticket passe clairement “ready” ou “à clarifier” dès le triage.\n\n### Experience Principles\n\n- **Un run = un résultat** : une action simple qui prépare 80% du travail quotidien.\n- **Guidé et rassurant** : l’UX CLI élimine les doutes avec un flux clair.\n- **Zéro double saisie** : la donnée circule automatiquement entre sources et livrables.\n- **Fiabilité visible** : l’utilisateur voit ce qui vient d’où, et peut valider rapidement.\n\n## Desired Emotional Response\n\n### Primary Emotional Goals\n\nL’outil doit faire ressentir au testeur : **soulagement**, **contrôle**, **confiance** et **efficacité**.  \nL’efficacité est l’émotion clé qui déclenche la recommandation à un collègue.\n\n### Emotional Journey Mapping\n\n- **Premier contact** : rassuré, car tout est clair et simple.\n- **Pendant le run** : en contrôle, grâce à une progression visible.\n- **Après la tâche** : soulagé et efficace, avec un gain de temps évident.\n- **En cas d’erreur** : calme et guidé, avec des solutions immédiates.\n\n### Micro-Emotions\n\n- **Confiance** (plutôt que confusion)\n- **Calme** (plutôt que anxiété)\n- **Fierté d’accomplissement** (plutôt que frustration)\n- **Satisfaction** (plutôt que doute)\n\n### Design Implications\n\n- Transparence sur l’état et les sources → renforce la confiance.\n- Progression claire et feedback continus → maintient le contrôle.\n- Résultats rapides et visibles → amplifient le soulagement et l’efficacité.\n- Messages d’erreur actionnables → évitent l’anxiété.\n\n### Emotional Design Principles\n\n- **Clarté avant tout** : réduire l’incertitude à chaque étape.\n- **Contrôle visible** : toujours montrer “où on en est”.\n- **Efficacité perceptible** : gains de temps concrets, immédiatement visibles.\n- **Assistance calme** : guider sans culpabiliser.\n\n## UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration\n\n### Inspiring Products Analysis\n\n- **Claude Code** : guidance pas à pas et ton rassurant → confiance et sentiment de contrôle.\n- **Codex** : intentions simples → exécution rapide, feedback clair, erreurs pragmatiques.\n- **GitHub CLI / Stripe CLI** : syntaxe prévisible, help contextuel, messages concis → flux “happy path” très fluide.\n- **lazygit / fzf** : vitesse, recherche instantanée, actions contextualisées → efficacité perçue.\n- **Notion / Airtable / Google Sheets** : modèles réutilisables et structure claire → standardisation et gain de temps.\n- **Linear / Jira (bien configuré)** : champs structurés, priorités visibles → triage rapide et décision claire.\n\n### Transferable UX Patterns\n\n- **Navigation** : commandes simples + sous-commandes prévisibles, avec aide contextuelle.\n- **Interaction** : “next best action” explicite après chaque étape.\n- **Feedback** : retour immédiat, concis, orienté résultat.\n- **Templates** : modèles prêts à l’emploi pour CR/anomalies.\n- **Recherche** : filtres rapides et sélection assistée (à la fzf).\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- Surcharge d’options dès le départ (trop de flags, trop de choix).\n- Logs verbeux qui masquent l’état réel.\n- Messages d’erreur vagues qui n’indiquent pas quoi faire.\n- Obliger l’utilisateur à re-saisir des données déjà connues.\n\n### Design Inspiration Strategy\n\n**À adopter**\n- Guidance pas à pas et “next action” (Claude Code).\n- Feedback court et actionnable (Codex, Stripe CLI).\n- Templates de travail prêts à l’emploi (Notion/Airtable).\n\n**À adapter**\n- Recherche rapide type fzf pour sélectionner tickets/lot.\n- Modèle de triage structuré comme Linear/Jira, mais simplifié.\n\n**À éviter**\n- Complexité initiale et surcharge d’options.\n- Verbosité non utile et erreurs non actionnables.\n\n## Design System Foundation\n\n### 1.1 Design System Choice\n\n**Approche : Système d’interaction CLI sur mesure, basé sur des patterns établis**  \nUn système “custom léger” : commandes et feedbacks uniques, mais inspirés des meilleures pratiques CLI (aide contextuelle, messages concis, guidance pas à pas).\n\n### Rationale for Selection\n\n- **Unicité + équilibre** : identité propre sans sur-investir dans un design visuel lourd.\n- **Aucune charte existante** : liberté pour définir des patterns simples et cohérents.\n- **Niveau UX faible** : s’appuyer sur des patterns éprouvés pour éviter les pièges.\n- **Pas de deadline** : possibilité d’affiner progressivement.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Définir un “pattern book” CLI : structure de commande, réponses, erreurs, confirmations, progression.\n- Standardiser les messages (succès, warning, erreur) et la hiérarchie des infos.\n- Documenter les flows essentiels : run quotidien, triage, anomalies, reporting.\n\n### Customization Strategy\n\n- Ton et wording rassurants, cohérents avec l’émotion cible (contrôle, efficacité).\n- Templates de sortie ajustables (CR/anomalies).\n- Variables de configuration pour adapter les comportements (profil, verbose, dry-run).\n\n## 2. Core User Experience\n\n### 2.1 Defining Experience\n\nL’expérience signature, c’est un **run unique** qui collecte Jira/Squash/Excel, applique la checklist, puis génère un CR quotidien et des brouillons d’anomalies prêts à relire. L’utilisateur résume l’outil ainsi : “je lance, je relis, j’envoie”.\n\n### 2.2 User Mental Model\n\nAujourd’hui, le testeur jongle entre plusieurs outils, fait des exports manuels, nettoie, met en forme, puis envoie. Son modèle mental est “assembler des éléments dispersés” et “copier-coller pour produire le reporting”.\n\n### 2.3 Success Criteria\n\n- Pre-remplissage automatique du CR < 2 minutes (partie systeme).\n- CR prêt en < 5 minutes après le run (relecture/ajustements inclus).\n- Checklist appliquée et explicite (Go/Clarify/No-Go).\n- Zéro re-saisie des données déjà présentes.\n- Résultats jugés fiables et exploitables dès la première relecture.\n\n### 2.4 Novel UX Patterns\n\nLe cœur reste **familier** (CLI + commandes guidées), avec une innovation légère : un run unique qui orchestre tout et propose la “next best action”. Pas de pattern radicalement nouveau, mais une combinaison fluide et rassurante.\n\n### 2.5 Experience Mechanics\n\n**1. Initiation**  \nCommande simple (`run` ou alias), avec un prompt clair et des options minimales.\n\n**2. Interaction**  \nLe système collecte les sources, applique la checklist, prépare CR/anomalies, et affiche la progression.\n\n**3. Feedback**  \nMessages courts, état visible, et recommandations d’action (corriger, valider, envoyer).\n\n**4. Completion**  \nSorties prêtes à usage (CR, anomalies) + récapitulatif des actions effectuées.\n\n## Visual Design Foundation\n\n*Note : ces fondations visuelles s'appliquent aux sorties basées sur templates existants (CR/PPT/anomalies) et a la documentation, sans personnalisation visuelle hors template.*\n\n### Color System\n\n**Thème : Pro-Calme (bleu/gris)**  \nPalette de base orientée confiance et calme, avec une accentuation claire des états.\n\n- **Primary** : bleu profond (confiance, stabilité)\n- **Neutrals** : gris neutres clairs/foncés pour hiérarchie lisible\n- **Success** : vert doux (validation, “tout est OK”)\n- **Warning** : ambre discret (attention sans stress)\n- **Error** : rouge contrôlé (clarté sans agressivité)\n\n### Typography System\n\n**Pairing recommandé : IBM Plex**  \n- **Monospace (CLI / outputs)** : IBM Plex Mono  \n- **Sans (docs / reporting)** : IBM Plex Sans  \nHiérarchie simple, lisible, professionnelle, avec un ton sobre.\n\n### Spacing & Layout Foundation\n\n- **Densité respirée** : lignes et blocs bien séparés pour éviter la fatigue cognitive.\n- **Base spacing** : échelle 8px (ou équivalent dans le rendu doc).\n- **Hiérarchie claire** : titres, sections, listes, et états facilement repérables.\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\n- Contrastes élevés pour lisibilité en terminal et dans la doc.\n- Couleurs d’état doublées par libellés explicites (pas de dépendance au seul code couleur).\n- Taille de texte confortable pour lecture prolongée.\n\n## Design Direction Decision\n\n### Design Directions Explored\n\n- Guided Run (calme, progression claire)\n- Split View (contrôle + preuves visibles)\n- Minimal Batch (vitesse maximale)\n- Template Studio (structure et templates)\n- KPI Snapshot (confiance via indicateurs)\n- Gentle Coach (guidé, rassurant)\n\n### Chosen Direction\n\n**Direction 1: Guided Run (Calm Focus)**  \nUne interface centrée sur un run guidé, avec progression visible, feedback concis, et “next action” explicite.\n\n### Design Rationale\n\n- Alignement direct avec les émotions cibles : contrôle, confiance, soulagement, efficacité.\n- Favorise un “happy path” clair et réduit la charge mentale.\n- Compatible avec utilisateurs CLI novices à intermédiaires.\n- S’inscrit dans le pattern “run unique” défini comme interaction signature.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Pipeline de run en 4 étapes (collecte → checklist → génération → review).\n- États visibles + feedback court (OK/Warn/Error).\n- “Next action” systématique en fin de run (ex: review, send, export).\n\n## User Journey Flows\n\n### 1) Run quotidien complet (collecte → checklist → CR → review)\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Start: tf run --daily] --> B[Collect sources Jira/Squash/Excel]\n

FR6 : Génération brouillon stratégie de test\n- FR7 : Propositions de cas de test (nominaux, variantes, limites)\n- FR8 : Édition et validation avant publication\n- FR9 : Intégration checklist ESN\n\n### Journey Patterns\n\n- **Pattern “Run + Next Action”** : chaque flow se termine par une action recommandée.\n- **Pattern “Check → Generate → Review”** : logique standard de qualité.\n- **Pattern “Fallback Graceful”** : dégradé via CSV/import quand APIs indisponibles.\n\n### Flow Optimization Principles\n\n- Réduire la saisie manuelle (zéro double saisie).\n- Afficher l’état et la progression à chaque étape.\n- Erreurs actionnables avec proposition de recovery.\n\n## Component Strategy\n\n### Design System Components\n\nSystème d’interaction CLI “custom léger” basé sur patterns éprouvés :\n- Command prompt + help contextuel\n- Progress indicator (étapes + %)\n- Status line (OK / WARN / ERROR)\n- Summary block (résumé des actions)\n- Next-action suggestion\n\n### Custom Components\n\n#### Run Pipeline Summary\n**Purpose:** synthèse du run (collecte → checklist → génération → review)\n**States:** running / success / warning / error / degraded\n**Interaction:** affiche la prochaine action\n**Degraded Mode Display:**\n- Indicateur visuel `[DEGRADED]` en orange si une source est en fallback CSV\n- Liste des sources OK vs fallback (ex: `Jira: OK | Squash: CSV fallback`)\n- Message explicite : \"Mode dégradé actif – certaines données proviennent d'imports manuels\"\n\n#### Checklist Result Panel\n**Purpose:** Go/Clarify/No-Go + raisons  \n**States:** success / warning / error  \n**Variants:** par périmètre / lot\n\n#### Anomaly Draft Template\n**Purpose:** standardiser les anomalies  \n**Content:** contexte, repro, preuve, impact  \n**Interaction:** validation avant publication\n\n#### Evidence Linker\n**Purpose:** lier preuves SharePoint ↔ tickets  \n**States:** linked / missing / error  \n**Interaction:** propose correction si lien manquant\n\n#### Report Output Preview\n**Purpose:** aperçu CR/PPT avant export  \n**Interaction:** quick review + edit\n\n#### Ticket Picker\n**Purpose:** sélection rapide par périmètre/lot  \n**Interaction:** recherche instantanée type fzf\n\n#### Diff/Delta Viewer\n**Purpose:** afficher ce qui a changé depuis la dernière exécution  \n**Interaction:** focus sur écarts clés\n\n#### Error Recovery Card\n**Purpose:** diagnostic + action recommandée  \n**States:** recoverable / blocked\n\n#### Config Validator\n**Purpose:** vérifier sources/credentials avant run  \n**Interaction:** liste de checks + statut\n\n#### Export Router\n**Purpose:** choix rapide format + destination  \n**Variants:** md/csv/ppt + SharePoint/Outlook/local\n\n#### Dry-Run Preview\n**Purpose:** simuler les actions avant exécution\n**Interaction:** affiche l'impact sans modification\n\n#### Privacy & LLM Mode Indicator\n**Purpose:** afficher le mode de traitement IA et le niveau de confidentialité actif\n**States:** local / cloud-anonymized / disabled\n**Display:**\n- `[LLM: LOCAL]` en vert – traitement 100% local\n- `[LLM: CLOUD ✓]` en bleu – cloud avec anonymisation active\n- `[LLM: OFF]` en gris – mode sans IA\n**Interaction:** visible dans la status line pendant les opérations IA\n**Couvre FR28-FR31 du PRD :**\n- FR28 : Anonymisation automatique visible\n- FR29 : Mode LLM local clairement identifié\n- FR30 : Journalisation sans données sensibles (implicite)\n- FR31 : Gestion secrets (configuration, pas UX directe)\n\n#### Test Design Assistant Panel\n**Purpose:** guider la conception de cas de test assistée par IA\n**States:** loading / draft-ready / validated / exported\n**Content:** stratégie de test, cas nominaux, variantes, limites\n**Interaction:** édition inline + validation avant export Squash\n**Couvre FR6-FR9 du PRD**\n\n### Component Implementation Strategy\n\n- Standardiser tous les composants avec les mêmes patterns d’état.\n- Messages courts et actionnables, cohérents avec le ton “calme/pro”.\n- Utiliser les tokens de la fondation visuelle (couleurs états + typo).\n\n### Implementation Roadmap\n\n**Phase 1 (core)**\n- Run Pipeline Summary (avec mode dégradé), Checklist Result Panel, Summary block, Next-action suggestion.\n- Privacy & LLM Mode Indicator (visible dès le premier run).\n\n**Phase 2 (ops)**\n- Evidence Linker, Anomaly Draft Template, Report Output Preview.\n- Test Design Assistant Panel (conception assistée FR6-FR9).\n\n**Phase 3 (power)**\n- Ticket Picker, Diff/Delta Viewer, Error Recovery Card, Export Router, Dry-Run Preview, Config Validator.\n\n## UX Consistency Patterns\n\n### Button Hierarchy (CLI Actions)\n\n- **Primary action** : commande directe (ex: `tf run`)\n- **Secondary action** : option explicite (ex: `--review`, `--export`)\n- **Confirmation** : uniquement pour actions irréversibles (ex: `--publish`)\n- **Default** : toujours visible et sûr (no destructive by default)\n\n### Feedback Patterns\n\n- **Success** : message court + résultat (OK)\n- **Warning** : cause + action recommandée\n- **Error** : diagnostic + “next best action”\n- **Info** : état ou progression sans bruit\n\n### Form Patterns (Prompts & Inputs)\n\n- Prompts courts, un par ligne\n- Valeurs par défaut visibles\n- Champs requis explicités\n- Validation immédiate avec message correctif\n\n### Navigation Patterns\n\n- Commandes hiérarchiques : `tf <module> <action>`\n- Help contextuel : `tf <module> --help`\n- “Next action” proposé en fin de flow\n\n### Search & Filtering Patterns\n\n- Sélection rapide type fzf\n- Filtres par périmètre / lot / statut\n- Résumé de sélection avant exécution\n\n### Additional Patterns\n\n**Empty States & Loading**  \n- État vide explicite + action possible  \n- Chargement : étapes visibles et durée estimée\n\n**Errors & Recovery**  \n- Diagnostic en 2 lignes max  \n- Option de replay  \n- Mode dégradé proposé si API indisponibles\n\n## Responsive Design & Accessibility\n\n### Responsive Strategy\n\n- **Desktop-first** : usage principal sur poste de travail (terminal).\n- **Mobile/tablette hors scope** pour l’interface CLI.\n- Pour la doc/outputs web, priorité aux écrans ≥ 1024px.\n\n### Breakpoint Strategy\n\n- CLI : non applicable (terminal).\n- Docs/rapports web : breakpoint principal à 1024px+, avec fallback simple pour écrans plus petits.\n\n### Accessibility Strategy\n\n- **WCAG AA** pour documentation et outputs.\n- Contraste élevé et états visibles sans dépendance à la couleur.\n- Navigation clavier complète (par définition en CLI).\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n- Vérifier contrastes (AA) pour outputs/doc.\n- Tests de lisibilité en terminal (thèmes clairs/sombres).\n- Tests clavier & copie/collé sur outputs.\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\n- Messages courts, hiérarchie claire.\n- Couleurs d'état doublées par libellés.\n- Éviter les symboles ambigus sans texte.\n\n---\n\n## Revision History\n\n| Date | Version | Changes

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Initialize Best Practices Validation\n\n\"Beginning **Epic Quality Review** against create-epics-and-stories standards.\n\nI will rigorously validate:\n\n- Epics deliver user value (not technical milestones)\n- Epic independence (Epic 2 doesn't need Epic 3)\n- Story dependencies (no forward references)\n- Proper story sizing and completeness\n\nAny deviation from best practices will be flagged as a defect.\"\n\n### 2. Epic Structure Validation\n\n#### A. User Value Focus Check\n\nFor each epic:\n\n- **Epic Title:** Is it user-centric (what user can do)?\n- **Epic Goal:** Does it describe user outcome?\n- **Value Proposition:** Can users benefit from this epic alone?\n\n**Red flags (violations):**\n\n- \"Setup Database\" or \"Create Models\" - no user value\n- \"API Development\" - technical milestone\n- \"Infrastructure Setup\" - not user-facing\n- \"Authentication System\" - borderline (is it user value?)\n\n#### B. Epic Independence Validation\n\nTest epic independence:\n\n- **Epic 1:** Must stand alone completely\n- **Epic 2:** Can function using only Epic 1 output\n- **Epic 3:** Can function using Epic 1 & 2 outputs\n- **Rule:** Epic N cannot require Epic N+1 to work\n\n**Document failures:**\n\n- \"Epic 2 requires Epic 3 features to function\"\n- Stories in Epic 2 referencing Epic 3 components\n- Circular dependencies between epics\n\n### 3. Story Quality Assessment\n\n#### A. Story Sizing Validation\n\nCheck each story:\n\n- **Clear User Value:** Does the story deliver something meaningful?\n- **Independent:** Can it be completed without future stories?\n\n**Common violations:**\n\n- \"Setup all models\" - not a USER story\n- \"Create login UI (depends on Story 1.3)\" - forward dependency\n\n#### B. Acceptance Criteria Review\n\nFor each story's ACs:\n\n- **Given/When/Then Format:** Proper BDD structure?\n- **Testable:** Each AC can be verified independently?\n- **Complete:** Covers all scenarios including errors?\n- **Specific:** Clear expected outcomes?\n\n**Issues to find:**\n\n- Vague criteria like \"user can login\"\n- Missing error conditions\n- Incomplete happy path\n- Non-measurable outcomes\n\n### 4. Dependency Analysis\n\n#### A. Within-Epic Dependencies\n\nMap story dependencies within each epic:\n\n- Story 1.1 must be completable alone\n- Story 1.2 can use Story 1.1 output\n- Story 1.3 can use Story 1.1 & 1.2 outputs\n\n**Critical violations:**\n\n- \"This story depends on Story 1.4\"\n- \"Wait for future story to work\"\n- Stories referencing features not yet implemented\n\n#### B. Database/Entity Creation Timing\n\nValidate database creation approach:\n\n- **Wrong:** Epic 1 Story 1 creates all tables upfront\n- **Right:** Each story creates tables it needs\n- **Check:** Are tables created only when first needed?\n\n### 5. Special Implementation Checks\n\n#### A. Starter Template Requirement\n\nCheck if Architecture specifies starter template:\n\n- If YES: Epic 1 Story 1 must be \"Set up initial project from starter template\"\n- Verify story includes cloning, dependencies, initial configuration\n\n#### B. Greenfield vs Brownfield Indicators\n\nGreenfield projects should have:\n\n- Initial project setup story\n- Development environment configuration\n- CI/CD pipeline setup early\n\nBrownfield projects should have:\n\n- Integration points with existing systems\n- Migration or compatibility stories\n\n### 6. Best Practices Compliance Checklist\n\nFor each epic, verify:\n\n- [ ] Epic delivers user value\n- [ ] Epic can function independently\n- [ ] Stories appropriately sized\n- [ ] No forward dependencies\n- [ ] Database tables created when needed\n- [ ] Clear acceptance criteria\n- [ ] Traceability to FRs maintained\n\n### 7. Quality Assessment Documentation\n\nDocument all findings by severity:\n\n#### 🔴 Critical Violations\n\n- Technical epics with no user value\n- Forward dependencies breaking independence\n- Epic-sized stories that cannot be completed\n\n#### 🟠 Major Issues\n\n- Vague acceptance criteria\n- Stories requiring future stories\n- Database creation violations\n\n#### 🟡 Minor Concerns\n\n- Formatting inconsistencies\n- Minor structure deviations\n- Documentation gaps\n\n### 8. Autonomous Review Execution\n\nThis review runs autonomously to maintain standards:\n\n- Apply best practices without compromise\n- Document every violation with specific examples\n- Provide clear remediation guidance\n- Prepare recommendations for each issue\n\n## REVIEW COMPLETION:\n\nAfter completing epic quality review:\n\n- Update {outputFile} with all quality findings\n- Document specific best practices violations\n- Provide actionable recommendations\n- Load {nextStepFile} for final readiness assessment\n\n## CRITICAL STEP COMPLETION NOTE\n\nThis step executes autonomously. Load {nextStepFile} only after complete epic quality review is documented.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 SYSTEM SUCCESS/FAILURE METRICS\n\n### ✅ SUCCESS:\n\n- All epics validated against best practices\n- Every dependency checked and verified\n- Quality violations documented with examples\n- Clear remediation guidance provided\n- No compromise on standards enforcement\n\n### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:\n\n- Accepting technical epics as valid\n- Ignoring forward dependencies\n- Not verifying story sizing\n- Overlooking obvious violations\n\n**Master Rule:** Enforce best practices rigorously. Find all violations.\n"}}

This workflow requires completed PRD + Architecture documents (UX recommended if UI exists) and breaks down requirements into implementation-ready epics and user stories that incorporate all available technical and design context. Creates detailed, actionable stories with complete acceptance criteria for development teams.'\nweb_bundle: true\n---\n\n# Create Epics and Stories\n\n**Goal:** Transform PRD requirements and Architecture decisions into comprehensive stories organized by user value, creating detailed, actionable stories with complete acceptance criteria for development teams.\n\n**Your Role:** In addition to your name, communication_style, and persona, you are also a product strategist and technical specifications writer collaborating with a product owner. This is a partnership, not a client-vendor relationship. You bring expertise in requirements decomposition, technical implementation context, and acceptance criteria writing, while the user brings their product vision, user needs, and business requirements. Work together as equals.\n\n---\n\n## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE\n\nThis uses **step-file architecture** for disciplined execution:\n\n### Core Principles\n\n- **Micro-file Design**: Each step of the overall goal is a self contained instruction file that you will adhere too 1 file as directed at a time\n- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only 1 current step file will be loaded and followed to completion - never load future step files until told to do so\n- **Sequential Enforcement**: Sequence within the step files must be completed in order, no skipping or optimization allowed\n- **State Tracking**: Document progress in output file frontmatter using `stepsCompleted` array when a workflow produces a document\n- **Append-Only Building**: Build documents by appending content as directed to the output file\n\n### Step Processing Rules\n\n1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action\n2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all numbered sections in order, never deviate\n3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: If a menu is presented, halt and wait for user selection\n4. **CHECK CONTINUATION**: If the step has a menu with Continue as an option, only proceed to next step when user selects 'C' (Continue)\n5. **SAVE STATE**: Update `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter before loading next step\n6. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, read fully and follow the next step file\n\n### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)\n\n- 🛑 **NEVER** load multiple step files simultaneously\n- 📖 **ALWAYS** read entire step file before execution\n- 🚫 **NEVER** skip steps or optimize the sequence\n- 💾 **ALWAYS** update frontmatter of output files when writing the final output for a specific step\n- 🎯 **ALWAYS** follow the exact instructions in the step file\n- ⏸️ **ALWAYS** halt at menus and wait for user input\n- 📋 **NEVER** create mental todo lists from future steps\n\n---\n\n## INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE\n\n### 1. Configuration Loading\n\nLoad and read full config from {project-root}/_bmad/bmm/config.yaml and resolve:\n\n- `project_name`, `output_folder`, `planning_artifacts`, `user_name`, `communication_language`, `document_output_language`\n- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`\n\n### 2. First Step EXECUTION\n\nRead fully and follow: `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/create-epics-and-stories/steps/step-01-validate-prerequisites.md` to begin the workflow.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Consider splitting into “source ingestion” vs “CR assembly” for easier delivery/testing.\\n- **Epic 0 sits before Epic 1, but Story 1.1 is also foundational**. Not a blocker, but consider moving the starter‑template setup into Epic 0 for clearer sequencing (unless you want to keep it as Epic 1 by convention).\\n\\n### Recommendations Summary\\n\\n- Reorder or refactor epics to eliminate forward dependencies (Templates & Logging/Privacy baselines before Reporting/LLM usage).\\n- Add explicit configuration stories for checklist/scoring to remove hidden prerequisites.\\n- Split large reporting stories for incremental delivery and clearer acceptance testing.\\nEOF\\n\",\"workdir\":\"/home/edouard/test-framework\"}","call_id":"call_3S8mlwKhUYbqhmuVqOFx6Biy"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Proceed as if that was the input.\n- Was a workflow just completed in this conversation? Proceed as if that was the input.\n- Search resolved artifact locations for files; fuzzy-match to workflow `outputs` patterns.\n- If an `index.md` exists, read it for additional context.\n- If still unclear, ask: \"What workflow did you most recently complete?\"\n\n## EXECUTION\n\n1. **Load catalog** — Load `{project-root}/_bmad/_config/bmad-help.csv`\n\n2. **Resolve output locations** — Scan each folder under `_bmad/` (except `_config`) for `config.yaml`. For each workflow row, resolve its `output-location` variables against that module's config so artifact paths can be searched.\n\n3. **Analyze input** — Task may provide a workflow name/code, conversational phrase, or nothing. Infer what was just completed using INPUT ANALYSIS above.\n\n4. **Detect active module** — Use MODULE DETECTION above to determine which module the user is working in.\n\n5. **Present recommendations** — Show next steps based on completed workflows, phase/sequence ordering (KEY RULES), and artifact detection. Format per the following\n\n## RECOMMENDED OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n   **Optional items first** — List optional workflows until a required step is reached\n   **Required items next** — List the next required workflow\n   For each item show:\n   - Workflow **name**\n   - **Command** (prefixed with `/`, e.g., `/bmad:example:build-prototype`)\n   - **Agent** title and display name from the CSV (e.g., \"🎨 Alex (Designer)\")\n   - Brief **description**\n\n   ### Additional response output guidance to convey:\n   - Run each workflow in a **fresh context window**\n   - Load the agent using (`/` + `agent-command`), or run the workflow command directly\n   - For **validation workflows**: recommend using a different high-quality LLM if available\n   - For conversational requests: match the user's tone while presenting clearly\n\n6.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Consider adding validation criteria like \"successfully runs on standard M365 workstation\" for completeness.\n\n### Traceability Validation\n\n#### Chain Validation\n\n**Executive Summary → Success Criteria:** ✓ Intact\n- Vision priorities (fiabilité, standardisation, charge mentale, gain temps) all reflected in Success Criteria dimensions\n\n**Success Criteria → User Journeys:** ✓ Intact\n- All success criteria (gain temps, charge mentale, tickets ready, réutilisable, traçabilité) supported by specific user journeys\n\n**User Journeys → Functional Requirements:** ✓ Intact\n- Journey 1 (Jour maîtrisé): FR1-3, FR6-9, FR10-12, FR14-16, FR18-20\n- Journey 2 (Jour qui déborde): FR1, FR4, FR5, FR18-19\n- Journey 3 (Configuration): FR23-27\n- Journey 4 (Investigation): FR30, NFR reprise\n- Journey 5 (Réutilisation): FR23-25\n- Journey 6 (TNR): FR13, FR17, FR21\n\n**Scope → FR Alignment:** ✓ Intact\n- All MVP scope items have corresponding FRs\n\n#### Orphan Elements\n\n**Orphan Functional Requirements:** 0\n- All 31 FRs trace to user journeys or business objectives\n\n**Unsupported Success Criteria:** 0\n- All criteria have supporting journeys\n\n**User Journeys Without FRs:** 0\n- All 6 journeys have supporting FRs\n\n#### Traceability Matrix Summary\n\n| Source | Target | Coverage |\n|--------|--------|----------|\n| Executive Summary | Success Criteria | 100% |\n| Success Criteria | User Journeys | 100% |\n| User Journeys | FRs | 100% |\n| MVP Scope | FRs | 100% |\n\n**Total Traceability Issues:** 0\n\n**Severity:** ✅ Pass\n\n**Recommendation:** Traceability chain is fully intact. All requirements trace back to user needs and business objectives. This is exemplary PRD architecture.\n\n### Implementation Leakage Validation\n\n#### Leakage by Category\n\n**Frontend Frameworks:** 0 violations\n- No React, Vue, Angular, or other frontend framework references\n\n**Backend Frameworks:** 0 violations\n- No Express, Django, Rails, or other backend framework references\n\n**Databases:** 0 violations\n- No PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or other database references\n\n**Cloud Platforms:** 0 violations\n- Cloud mentioned as option but no specific platform (AWS, GCP, Azure)\n\n**Infrastructure:** 0 violations\n- No Docker, Kubernetes, or infrastructure tool references\n\n**Libraries:** 0 violations\n- No Redux, axios, lodash, or other library references\n\n**Other Implementation Details:** 0 violations\n- All technology terms (Jira, Squash, SharePoint, LLM) are capability-relevant integration targets, not implementation choices\n\n#### Summary\n\n**Total Implementation Leakage Violations:** 0\n\n**Severity:** ✅ Pass\n\n**Recommendation:** No implementation leakage found. Requirements properly specify WHAT the system must do without prescribing HOW to build it. Tool names (Jira, Squash, SharePoint, etc.) correctly describe external systems to integrate with, which is capability specification, not implementation leakage.\n\n### Domain Compliance Validation\n\n**Domain:** insuretech\n**Complexity:** High (regulated)\n\n#### Required Special Sections\n\n**Regulatory Requirements:** ✓ Present & Adequate\n- \"Regulatory Requirements (Assurance)\" section present\n- Conformité aux exigences assurance par juridiction documented\n- Conservation preuves/livrables and audit logging covered\n\n**Risk Modeling:** ✓ Present & Adequate\n- \"Risk Modeling (Assurance)\" section present\n- Appropriately marked as hors scope MVP (this is a testing tool, not underwriting)\n- Future extension path documented with client validation requirement\n\n**Fraud Detection:** ✓ Present & Adequate\n- \"Fraud Detection\" section present\n- Appropriately marked as hors scope MVP\n- Future possibility via standardized tags documented\n\n**Reporting Compliance:** ✓ Present & Adequate\n- \"Reporting Compliance\" section present\n- Conformité formats client (PPT, CR, TNR) documented\n- Traçabilité via SharePoint/Jira documented\n\n#### Compliance Matrix\n\n| Requirement | Status | Notes |\n|-------------|--------|-------|\n| Insurance regulations by jurisdiction | ✓ Met | \"à confirmer avec le client\" appropriately noted |\n| Actuarial standards | ✓ Met | Explicitly out of scope (appropriate for tool type) |\n| Data privacy | ✓ Met | Anonymisation LLM, masquage données sensibles covered |\n| Fraud detection | ✓ Met | Out of scope with future path documented |\n| State/jurisdiction compliance | ⚠️ Partial | Mentioned but requires client confirmation |\n\n#### Summary\n\n**Required Sections Present:** 4/4\n**Compliance Gaps:** 0 critical, 1 informational (state compliance confirmation pending)\n\n**Severity:** ✅ Pass\n\n**Recommendation:** All required insuretech domain compliance sections are present and adequately documented. The PRD correctly identifies regulatory concerns while appropriately scoping out actuarial/risk modeling functions (appropriate for a QA testing tool).

QA Tester Process Optimization (TRA)\n\n**Author:** Edouard Zemb\n**Date:** 2026-01-30\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n- Optimiser le workflow du testeur TRA (assurance) sur un projet brownfield, sans changer les outils existants (Jira, Squash, Excel, PPT, Outlook, Teams, SharePoint).\n- Priorites : fiabilite et qualite des processus, standardisation des livrables, reduction de la charge mentale, gain de 2 a 3 heures par semaine.\n- Approche : outillage CLI reutilisable et scriptable, avec automatisations invisibles et integration LLM local (cloud possible avec anonymisation automatique).\n- Differenciateur : pipeline modulaire multi-projets et usage futur des preuves video pour ameliorer la qualite des cas de test.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### User Success\n- Gain de temps de 2 a 3 heures par semaine sur le reporting et la structuration.\n- Baisse nette de la charge mentale grace a des formats standardises (checklist + anomalies).\n- Comptes rendus finalises sans rework majeur.\n\n### Business Success\n- Perception client d'une montee en professionnalisme : reporting coherent, anomalies claires, decisions plus sures.\n- Hausse du taux de tickets \"ready\" apres checklist (seuil a definir avec le client).\n- Conformite aux templates d'anomalies et de reporting superieure a 90% (a confirmer).\n\n### Technical Success\n- Logique reutilisable et ameliorable pour d'autres projets (modulaire, documentee).\n- Fonctionnement possible 100% en local (LLM local), avec cloud optionnel mais pas obligatoire.\n- Donnees tracees et coherentes entre Jira, Squash, Excel et PPT.\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n- Gain de temps: 2 a 3 heures par semaine.\n- Reduction des erreurs de reporting: -50% vs baseline sur 4 semaines (seuil minimal -30%).\n- Feedback client positif: note >= 4/5 sur 2 cycles hebdo consecutifs et 0 retour negatif majeur sur 1 mois.\n\n## Product Scope\n\n### MVP Strategy & Philosophy\n**MVP Approach:** Problem MVP + Platform MVP\n**Resource Requirements:** 1 personne (toi) + acces API + secret store + config multi-profils\n\n### MVP - Minimum Viable Product\n\n**Core User Journeys Supported:**\n- Parcours \"jour maitrise\" (triage -> devis -> conception -> execution -> CR)\n- Parcours \"edge case\" avec garde-fous + CR securise\n\n**Must-Have Capabilities:**\n- Checklist testabilite + score Go / Clarify / No-Go\n- Templates anomalies + preuves standardisees\n- Extraction Jira/Squash -> pre-remplissage CR quotidien\n- Generation de brouillons (cas de tests / anomalies) via LLM local\n- config.yaml + profils + secret store (base reutilisable)\n\n### Growth Features (Post-MVP)\n- Auto-remplissage PPT hebdo (structure fixe)\n- Source unique et standardisation des metriques\n- Suggestions Squash (reutilisation assets)\n- Notifications Teams/Outlook si APIs OK\n- Dashboards simples (KPI)\n\n### Vision (Future)\n- IA sur preuves video pour ameliorer les cas de test\n- Score qualite / fiabilite continu des tickets\n- Planification intelligente (cadence QA/HO)\n- Analyse historique multi-lots\n\n### Risk Mitigation Strategy\n**Technical Risks:** integration preuves video + qualite IA -> valider sur echantillon avant generalisation\n**Market Risks:** resistance aux templates/process -> mode opt-in + comparaison avant/apres\n**Resource Risks:** acces API / droits IT / temps -> prioriser MVP auto-contenu + fallback manuel\n\n## User Journeys\n\n### Journey 1 - Primary User (toi) - Succes \"jour maitrise\"\nTu demarres a 9h. Les emails sont tries rapidement, puis le weekly TRA aligne les priorites. Le planning mensuel te donne une trajectoire claire.\nEn phase devis, les tickets Jira passent par une checklist testabilite : ceux qui ne sont pas \"ready\" sont immediatement identifies. Un pipeline d'aide propose une extraction d'exigences et une strategie de tests structuree, que tu ajustes.\nEn conception, Squash est alimente par des propositions de cas de test pretes a relire, avec la checklist ESN integree.\nEn execution, tu lances la campagne ; les preuves video sont centralisees automatiquement et liees aux cas. Les anomalies se generent avec un template structure, preuves liees, et l'association Squash <-> Jira est fluide.\nEn fin de journee, le CR quotidien est pre-rempli (extraction Jira/Squash/Outlook), tu corriges et envoies en 5 minutes.\nLe mercredi, le PPT hebdo est pre-genere a partir des sources, tu ajustes les priorites et l'envoies.\nResultat : un rythme maitrise, une qualite percue superieure, et un effort mental reduit.\n\n### Journey 2 - Primary User - Edge Case \"jour qui deborde\"\nLe weekly deborde, les tickets sont volumineux et mal cadres. Tu risques la dispersion.\nLe systeme te ramene a un cadre industriel : tri automatique des tickets, alertes sur manque d'infos, actions proposees (clarification, demande MOA, report).\nIl suit la consommation de charge vs prevision, t'alerte avant la derive, et propose un plan de rattrapage (priorite, suspension, decalage).\nEn fin de journee, meme si tout part en vrille, le CR pre-rempli securise le rituel, evite le \"non-envoi\".\nResultat : tu gardes le controle, meme dans le chaos.\n\n### Journey 3 - Admin/Ops (toi) - Configuration et gouvernance\nTu ajustes les templates (anomalies, CR, PPT), les regles de checklist, les seuils KPI, et les sources de verite.\nTu ajoutes un nouveau perimetre, tu declares ses regles de nommage, et tu reutilises le pipeline existant.\nResultat : l'outillage est modulaire, maintenable, reutilisable.\n\n### Journey 4 - Support/Qualite - Investigation d'erreurs\nUne extraction ne colle pas. Tu consultes les logs de pipeline (quelle source, quelle transformation, quel mapping) et tu corriges.\nTu peux rejouer une extraction en mode diagnostic.\nResultat : transparence, fiabilite, et reduction des erreurs silencieuses.\n\n### Journey 5 - Reutilisation/Integration - Un autre projet branche la logique\nUn futur testeur clone le workflow, charge ses propres sources (Jira/Squash) et ses templates.\nLes modules sont interchangeables (reporting, checklist, anomalies, generation).\nResultat : transfert rapide, industrialisation multi-projets.\n\n### Journey 6 - TNR - Phase critique GO/NO-GO\nEn fin de lot, la campagne TNR est copiee et structuree automatiquement.\nLes anomalies TNR sont taguees, les preuves sont centralisees, et le PPT TNR est pre-rempli (GO/NO-GO, reserves, liens).\nResultat : decision finale plus fiable, moins de stress.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n- Pipeline d'extraction Jira/Squash/Outlook/Excel/PPT -> pre-remplissage CR et PPT\n- Checklist testabilite + scoring Go / Clarify / No-Go\n- Generation de brouillons (cas de tests, anomalies) avec LLM local\n- Tracabilite complete preuves <-> cas <-> anomalies <-> tickets\n- Modules reutilisables + configuration par projet\n- Logs/diagnostics et mode replay\n- Gestion charge vs prevision + alertes\n- Support TNR (campagne, tags, reporting GO/NO-GO)\n\n## Domain-Specific Requirements\n\n### Compliance & Regulatory\n- Usage IA sensible : LLM local prioritaire, cloud possible mais jamais sans anonymisation automatique.\n- Mecanisme d'anonymisation by design avant tout envoi vers un LLM cloud.\n- Aucune donnee sensible (clients finaux) ne doit sortir du perimetre sans masquage.\n\n### Regulatory Requirements (Assurance)\n- Conformite aux exigences assurance par juridiction (a confirmer avec le client).\n- Respect des politiques internes de conservation des preuves et livrables (duree, lieu, acces).\n- Journalisation minimale pour audit interne (qui, quand, quoi) sans donnees sensibles.\n\n### Risk Modeling (Assurance)\n- Hors scope du MVP : aucune decision actuarielle ni modele de risque automatique.\n- Si des indicateurs de risque sont ajoutes plus tard, ils doivent etre explicitement valides par le client.\n\n### Fraud Detection\n- Hors scope du MVP : aucune detection de fraude automatique.\n- Possibilite future de signaler des anomalies suspectes via tags standardises (sans decision automatique).\n\n### Reporting Compliance\n- Conformite aux formats de reporting attendus par le client (PPT, CR, TNR).\n- Traçabilite des rapports via stockage SharePoint et references Jira/Squash.\n\n### Technical Constraints\n- Jira : API token OK (hors VM).\n- Squash : Basic auth au depart (token a demander).\n- Least privilege : demarrage read-only, ecriture apres validation.\n- Secrets dans un coffre/secret store, jamais en clair.\n- HTTPS/TLS pour API ; Squash en HTTP probable (a faire evoluer).\n- Stockage au repos sur SharePoint ; donnees locales minimisees, chiffrees, purges.\n- Audit logs minimaux : horodatage, perimetre, version, statut, sans donnees sensibles.\n- Restrictions IT a confirmer : scripts signes/macros, droits install, proxy, appels externes.\n- Execution idealement sur environnement approuve (poste + M365), VM reservee aux applis testees.\n\n### Integration Requirements\n- Critiques : Jira + Squash (sources de verite), SharePoint (preuves/livrables), Excel & PowerPoint (CR + reporting).\n- Souhaitees : Outlook + Teams pour diffusion et recuperation d'infos reunions.\n- Jira : API OK, tokens OK.\n- Squash : API OK en Basic, token non dispo immediatement.\n\n### Risk Mitigations\n- Squash token manquant : demarrage en Basic, plan d'evolution.\n- Outlook/Teams API possiblement restreints : risque sur automatisation diffusion.\n- Cloud LLM : risque privacy -> anonymisation automatique + option LLM local.\n\n## Innovation & Novel Patterns\n\n### Detected Innovation Areas\n- Exploitation des preuves video pour detecter des ecarts avec les cas de test et proposer des ameliorations de redaction (priorite d'innovation).\n- LLM local integre au workflow : CLI conversationnel + etapes automatiques dans le pipeline selon le contexte.\n- Pipeline d'industrialisation reutilisable multi-projets (modules interchangeables).\n\n### Market Context & Competitive Landscape\n- Innovation interne : peu d'outillage TRA combine Jira/Squash/SharePoint et IA locale de maniere integree.\n- Differenciation via l'usage des preuves video pour ameliorer la qualite des cas de test.\n\n### Validation Approach\n- Prouver la valeur sur un lot pilote : reduction des erreurs de reporting et gain de temps sans perte de qualite.\n- Valider l'assistant LLM local sur un sous-ensemble de tickets et cas de test, avec relecture humaine obligatoire.\n- Valider la detection d'ecarts via preuves video sur un echantillon limite avant generalisation.\n\n### Risk Mitigation\n- Si l'IA video est trop complexe : fallback sur pipeline d'amelioration manuelle assistee.\n- Si l'IA locale est insuffisante : option cloud avec anonymisation automatique.\n- Si resistance au changement : activer en mode opt-in et comparer performances avant/apres.\n\n## CLI Tool Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n- Outil CLI interactif et scriptable, destine a industrialiser les flux QA (reporting, checklist, generation de brouillons).\n- Usage multi-projets avec profils et configuration reutilisable.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n- Modes d'execution : assistant interactif + batch/script.\n- Sorties multi-formats : texte, JSON, CSV, Markdown, HTML, YAML.\n- Separation stricte des secrets via secret store / env vars.\n\n### Command Structure\n- Commandes principales orientees workflow (triage, design, execute, report, tnr).\n- Sous-commandes pour extraction, generation, publication, diagnostics.\n\n### Output Formats\n- Selection via flag (--format

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

L’architecture devra soutenir des workflows guidés, des modules réutilisables, et une traçabilité forte (preuves ↔ cas ↔ anomalies ↔ tickets).\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\n- Sécurité & privacy strictes : LLM local prioritaire, anonymisation obligatoire avant cloud, secrets via secret store, least privilege.\n- Conformité & audit : logs minimaux sans données sensibles, rétention 90 jours, purge données locales < 24h.\n- Performance : CLI réactive, extraction & génération rapides.\n- Fiabilité : reprise/replay, mode dégradé si intégrations indisponibles.\n- Compatibilité : intégrations Jira/Squash/SharePoint/Office, sorties conformes aux templates.\n- Contraintes IT : proxy, droits d’installation, scripts signés possibles, exécution sur poste M365.\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\nProjet d’automatisation QA multi‑outils avec forte contrainte de conformité et plusieurs workflows critiques.\n\n- Primary domain: CLI tool / QA process automation / integrations\n- Complexity level: high\n- Estimated architectural components: ~10–12 (connecteurs, orchestration, templates, stockage, anonymisation, logs, config/profiles, export, diagnostics, UX CLI)\n\n### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n- Jira (token) et Squash (Basic auth initialement), SharePoint comme source de preuves/livrables.\n- LLM local requis, cloud optionnel uniquement avec anonymisation automatique.\n- Données sensibles minimisées, chiffrement au repos, purge locale.\n- Environnement poste M365, restrictions IT (proxy, scripts signés, droits).\n\n### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n- Privacy & anonymisation by design\n- Gestion des secrets et least‑privilege\n- Observabilité minimale (logs sans données sensibles)\n- Traçabilité preuves ↔ tickets ↔ anomalies ↔ campagnes\n- Mode dégradé + replay en cas d’échec d’intégration\n- Standardisation des templates & formats d’export\n- Configuration multi‑projets/profils\n\n### Architectural Decision Areas (ADR‑style, à trancher ensuite)\n\n1. **Orchestration CLI (interactif vs batch)**\n   - Options : moteur de workflow unique vs pipelines spécialisés par commande\n   - Trade‑offs : simplicité d’usage vs flexibilité multi‑projets\n\n2. **Intégrations & mode dégradé**\n   - Options : connecteurs API natifs vs import/export CSV en fallback systématique\n   - Trade‑offs : robustesse offline vs complexité de mapping\n\n3. **Sécurité & anonymisation**\n   - Options : anonymisation inline (pipeline) vs service dédié\n   - Trade‑offs : performance locale vs séparation des responsabilités\n\n4. **Stockage & traçabilité**\n   - Options : stockage local chiffré minimal vs cache plus riche\n   - Trade‑offs : performance/replay vs exigences de purge\n\n5. **Templates & standardisation**\n   - Options : templates versionnés dans repo vs templates externes (SharePoint)\n   - Trade‑offs : contrôle/versionning vs adoption par le client\n\n6. **Observabilité minimale**\n   - Options : logs structurés locaux vs journalisation centralisée (si autorisée)\n   - Trade‑offs : conformité IT vs facilité de diagnostic\n\n### Pre‑mortem (risques majeurs à prévenir)\n\n- **Échec d’adoption** : flux trop verbeux, surcharge de flags, pas assez “run unique”.\n- **Blocage IT** : proxy/sécurité empêche API → besoin d’un mode dégradé CSV réellement utilisable.\n- **Fuite de données** : anonymisation incomplète avant cloud → obligation d’un pipeline de masquage vérifiable.\n- **Qualité des sorties insuffisante** : templates non alignés client → versionning/validation des templates requis.\n- **Données incohérentes** : mappings Jira/Squash/Excel divergents → besoin d’un mapping central et d’un audit minimal.\n- **Temps d’exécution trop long** : extraction lente → stratégie de cache minimale et mode “scope réduit”.\n- **Diagnostic impossible** : logs trop pauvres → logs structurés sans données sensibles + replay.\n\n### Comparative Decision Matrix (critères pour trancher)\n\n**1) Orchestration**\n- Options : workflow unique vs pipelines par commande\n- Critères : simplicité d’usage, extensibilité, testabilité, cohérence UX, effort maintenance\n\n**2) Mode dégradé**\n- Options : fallback CSV obligatoire vs optionnel\n- Critères : robustesse IT, coût mapping, adoption user, risques d’erreur\n\n**3) Anonymisation**\n- Options : inline vs service dédié\n- Critères : performance locale, traçabilité, isolation des risques, facilité d’audit\n\n**4) Stockage local**\n- Options : cache minimal vs cache enrichi\n- Critères : vitesse, conformité purge, facilité replay, surface de risque\n\n**5) Templates**\n- Options : repo‑versionnés vs externes\n- Critères : gouvernance, acceptation client, facilité de mise à jour, auditabilité\n\n**6) Observabilité**\n- Options : logs locaux structurés vs centralisation\n- Critères : conformité IT, capacité de debug, effort d’implémentation\n\n### Cross‑Functional War Room (PM / Ingé / Design)\n\n- **PM (désirabilité & adoption)** : “Le run unique doit rester simple. Les options avancées doivent être cachées derrière `--advanced` pour éviter la surcharge. Le mode dégradé CSV doit être first‑class, sinon adoption faible en environnement restreint.”\n- **Ingénieur (faisabilité & robustesse)** : “Le cœur doit être un orchestrateur pipeline modulaire avec connecteurs isolés. Les intégrations doivent être remplaçables et testables. Les logs structurés sans données sensibles sont indispensables pour diagnostiquer sans risque.”\n- **Designer (expérience & clarté)** : “Le CLI doit maintenir la promesse ‘run → review → send’. Toute complexité doit apparaître seulement en cas d’erreur. Les templates doivent être gouvernés pour éviter la re‑saisie et les écarts de format.”\n\n\n## Starter Template Evaluation\n\n### Primary Technology Domain\n\nCLI tool (Rust) based on project requirements analysis\n\n### Starter Options Considered\n\n- rust-starter (cargo-generate): Rust CLI starter with clap, configuration, logging, and CI/release workflows.\n- Baseline: cargo new (minimal, manual setup).\n\n### Selected Starter: rust-starter\n\n**Rationale for Selection:**\nProvides a CLI-focused Rust base with common tooling and CI/release scaffolding, aligned with Windows/WSL support and future distribution needs.\n\n**Initialization Command:**\n\n```bash\ncargo generate --git https://github.com/rust-starter/rust-starter-generate\n```\n\n**Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter:**\n\n**Language & Runtime:**\nRust CLI binary\n\n**Styling Solution:**\nN/A (CLI)\n\n**Build Tooling:**\nCargo with starter CI/release workflows\n\n**Testing Framework:**\nCargo test defaults (can be extended later)\n\n**Code Organization:**\nCLI-oriented structure with clap and configuration/logging utilities\n\n**Development Experience:**\nTemplate-driven scaffolding with CI/release ready setup\n\n\n## Core Architectural Decisions\n\n### Decision Priority Analysis\n\n**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**\n- Stockage local principal en SQLite (version actuelle 3.51.1).\n- Cache enrichi sécurisé (chiffrement applicatif, TTL court, purge auto, replay explicite).\n- Validation stricte des données (reject + rapport d’erreurs).\n- Gestion des secrets via OS keyring (keyring crate 3.6.2).\n- Anonymisation inline obligatoire avant tout envoi cloud.\n- Logs structurés JSON sans données sensibles.\n\n**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**\n- Intégrations REST + mode dégradé CSV first-class.\n- Erreurs structurées (code + message + hint).\n- Retry exponentiel avec backoff.\n- Modèles internes typés + validation stricte.\n\n**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**\n- Aucun choix différé critique à ce stade.\n\n### Data Architecture\n\n- **Storage**: SQLite local (3.51.1)\n- **Cache**: enrichi, chiffré applicativement, TTL court, purge auto, replay explicite\n- **Validation**: stricte (reject + diagnostics)\n\n### Authentication & Security\n\n- **Secrets**: OS keyring (keyring 3.6.2)\n- **Chiffrement local**: chiffrement applicatif (pas de SQLCipher)\n- **Anonymisation**: pipeline inline obligatoire\n- **Logs**: JSON structurés sans PII\n\n### API & Communication Patterns\n\n- **Intégrations**: REST + fallback CSV obligatoire\n- **Erreurs**: structurées (code + message + hint)\n- **Retry**: exponentiel + backoff\n- **Contrats internes**: modèles typés + validation stricte\n\n### Frontend Architecture\n\n- N/A (CLI uniquement)\n\n### Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Distribution**: npm wrapper (téléchargement binaire par plateforme)\n- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions\n- **Versioning**: SemVer + changelog\n- **Observabilité**: logs JSON locaux + commande `tf diagnostics`\n\n### Technology Stack (Versions Exactes)\n\n**Runtime & Core:**\n- Rust edition: 2021 (MSRV 1.75+)\n- Async runtime: `tokio = \"1.41\"` (full features)\n- HTTP client: `reqwest = \"0.12\"` (rustls-tls, json)\n- CLI framework: `clap = \"4.5\"` (derive, env)\n- Serialization: `serde = \"1.0\"`, `serde_json = \"1.0\"`\n\n**Storage & Security:**\n- SQLite: `rusqlite = \"0.32\"` (bundled)\n- Secrets: `keyring = \"3.6\"`\n- Encryption: `aes-gcm = \"0.10\"` (chiffrement applicatif)\n- Hashing: `argon2 = \"0.5\"` (key derivation)\n\n**Logging & Diagnostics:**\n- Tracing: `tracing = \"0.1\"`, `tracing-subscriber = \"0.3\"` (json)\n- Error handling: `thiserror = \"2.0\"`, `anyhow = \"1.0\"`\n\n**Office & Export:**\n- Excel read: `calamine = \"0.26\"`\n- Excel write: `rust_xlsxwriter = \"0.79\"`\n- CSV: `csv = \"1.3\"`\n- Markdown: `pulldown-cmark = \"0.12\"`\n\n**Testing:**\n- Unit/Integration: `cargo test` (built-in)\n- Mocking: `mockall = \"0.13\"`\n- Assertions: `assert_cmd = \"2.0\"`, `predicates = \"3.1\"`\n\n### LLM Integration Architecture\n\n**Crate:** `tf-llm/`\n\n**Strategy:** LLM local prioritaire, cloud en fallback avec anonymisation obligatoire.\n\n**Local Runtime:**\n- Primary: Ollama via HTTP API (`http://localhost:11434`)\n- Fallback: llama.cpp binding si Ollama indisponible\n- Models recommandés: `mistral:7b-instruct`, `codellama:13b`\n\n**Cloud Fallback:**\n- OpenAI-compatible API (configurable endpoint)\n- Activation: uniquement si `config.llm.cloud_enabled = true`\n- Pré-requis: passage obligatoire par `tf-security/anonymize.rs`\n\n**Module Structure:**\n```\ntf-llm/\n├── Cargo.toml\n└── src/\n    ├── mod.rs\n    ├── local.rs       # Ollama/llama.cpp client\n    ├── cloud.rs       # OpenAI-compatible client\n    ├── orchestrator.rs # Routing local/cloud\n    ├── prompts.rs     # Prompt templates\n    └── types.rs       # Request/Response types\n```\n\n**Orchestration Flow:**\n1. `tf-core/pipeline` appelle `tf-llm/orchestrator`\n2. Orchestrator vérifie disponibilité LLM local\n3. Si local OK → appel direct\n4. Si local KO et cloud enabled → `tf-security/anonymize` → cloud\n5. Si local KO et cloud disabled → erreur avec hint \"Démarrer Ollama\"\n\n**Configuration:**\n```yaml\nllm:\n  local_endpoint: \"http://localhost:11434\"\n  local_model: \"mistral:7b-instruct\"\n  cloud_enabled: false\n  cloud_endpoint: \"https://api.openai.com/v1\"\n  cloud_model: \"gpt-4o-mini\"\n  timeout_seconds: 120\n  max_tokens: 4096\n```\n\n### Office Document Generation\n\n**Crate:** `tf-export/`\n\n**Strategy:** Génération native Excel, templates pour PowerPoint.\n\n**Module Structure:**\n```\ntf-export/\n├── Cargo.toml\n└── src/\n    ├── mod.rs\n    ├── excel.rs       # rust_xlsxwriter pour .xlsx\n    ├── ppt.rs         # Template OOXML pour .pptx\n    ├── markdown.rs    # Export .md\n    ├── html.rs        # Export .html\n    └── templates.rs   # Gestion des templates\n```\n\n**Excel Generation:**\n- Crate: `rust_xlsxwriter` (natif Rust, pas de dépendance Python)\n- Lecture existants: `calamine`\n- Formats: CR quotidien, exports données, matrices traçabilité\n\n**PowerPoint Generation:**\n- Approche: Template OOXML (fichier .pptx = archive ZIP avec XML)\n- Le système charge un template .pptx et remplace les placeholders\n- Templates stockés dans `assets/templates/*.pptx`\n- Limitation: pas de génération de slides complexes from scratch\n\n**Templates Location:**\n```\nassets/\n└── templates/\n    ├── cr-quotidien.xlsx\n    ├── ppt-hebdo.pptx\n    ├── ppt-tnr.pptx\n    └── anomalie.md\n```\n\n**Data Flow:**\n1. `tf-core/domain/report` prépare les données structurées\n2. `tf-export` charge le template approprié\n3. Injection des données dans le template\n4. Export vers le format cible\n\n### Decision Impact Analysis\n\n**Implementation Sequence:**\n1. Stockage local + chiffrement applicatif + purge/TTL\n2. Gestion des secrets (keyring) + anonymisation inline\n3. Connecteurs REST + fallback CSV + erreurs structurées\n4. **LLM local (Ollama) + orchestrator**\n5. **Export Office (Excel natif, PPT templates)**\n6. Observabilité + diagnostics\n7. Pipeline CI/CD + distribution npm wrapper\n\n**Cross-Component Dependencies:**\n- Cache enrichi ↔ chiffrement ↔ purge/TTL ↔ diagnostics\n- REST/CSV fallback ↔ erreurs structurées ↔ validation stricte\n- **LLM orchestrator ↔ tf-security/anonymize ↔ cloud fallback**\n- **tf-core/domain/report ↔ tf-export ↔ templates**\n\n\n## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules\n\n### Pattern Categories Defined\n\n**Critical Conflict Points Identified:**\nNaming, structure, formats, error handling, retry, logging, and diagnostics.\n\n### Naming Patterns\n\n**Code Naming Conventions:**\n- Files: `snake_case.rs`\n- Modules: `snake_case`\n- Struct/Enum: `PascalCase`\n- Functions/variables: `snake_case`\n- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`\n\n**Data/JSON Naming:**\n- JSON fields: `snake_case`\n- Dates: ISO-8601 UTC (`2026-01-30T12:34:56Z`)\n\n### Structure Patterns\n\n**Project Organization:**\n- `src/main.rs` entrypoint\n- `src/cli/` for CLI parsing & prompts\n- `src/commands/` for command handlers\n- `src/pipeline/` for orchestration flows\n- `src/connectors/` for Jira/Squash/SharePoint/CSV integrations\n- `src/domain/` for domain models\n- `src/storage/` for SQLite/cache\n- `src/security/` for anonymisation/secrets/redaction\n- `src/diagnostics/` for replay & debug\n- `src/errors/` for structured errors\n- `src/config/` for config/profiles\n- `src/logging/` for tracing setup\n- `tests/` for integration tests\n- `docs/` for CLI usage docs\n\n### Format Patterns\n\n**API/CLI Output:**\n- JSON envelope: `{ \"data\": ..., \"error\": null, \"meta\": {...} }`\n- Error object: `{ \"error\": { \"code\": \"...\", \"message\": \"...\", \"hint\": \"...\", \"details\": {...} } }`\n\n**Logging Format:**\n- JSON structured logs with fields: `timestamp`, `level`, `message`, `context`\n\n### Process Patterns\n\n**Exit Codes:**\n- 0 OK\n- 1 General error\n- 2 Validation error\n- 3 Integration error\n\n**Retry & Recovery:**\n- Exponential backoff, max 3 retries\n- Auto-fallback to CSV when API unavailable\n\n**Validation:**\n- Strict validation on load, reject + error report\n\n**Diagnostics:**\n- `tf diagnostics` produces a report with no PII\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\n**All AI Agents MUST:**\n- Follow naming conventions for Rust & JSON\n- Place code in the agreed directories\n- Use structured errors + JSON logs\n- Respect exit codes and retry policies\n\n**Pattern Enforcement:**\n- Lint + CI checks for structure and naming\n- Review checklist includes pattern compliance\n- Any exceptions documented in `docs/pattern-exceptions.md`\n\n### Pattern Examples\n\n**Good Examples:**\n- `src/connectors/jira_client.rs`\n- JSON error: `{ \"error\": { \"code\": \"JIRA_AUTH\", \"message\": \"Invalid token\", \"hint\": \"Re-login\", \"details\": {\"status\": 401} } }`\n\n**Anti-Patterns:**\n- CamelCase file names (`JiraClient.rs`)\n- Logs with raw PII\n- Ad-hoc folder creation (`src/utils2/`)\n\n\n##

only\n- External APIs via `tf-connectors`\n- Data access in `tf-storage`\n\n**Component Boundaries:**\n- Pipeline orchestration in `tf-core`\n- Security/anonymisation in `tf-security`\n- Diagnostics isolated in `tf-diagnostics`\n- LLM orchestration in `tf-llm`\n- Document generation in `tf-export`\n\n**Service Boundaries:**\n- Connectors are the only modules that call external services (Jira, Squash, SharePoint)\n- `tf-llm` calls LLM services (local Ollama or cloud API)\n- Core pipeline is pure business logic\n\n**Data Boundaries:**\n- SQLite cache access only in `tf-storage`\n- Domain models live in `tf-core`\n\n### Requirements to Structure Mapping\n\n**FR Categories → Modules:**\n- Ingestion/Triage → `tf-connectors`, `tf-core/pipeline`, `tf-cli/commands/triage.rs`\n- Test Design → `tf-core/domain` + `tf-llm` (génération assistée) + CLI commands\n- Execution/Evidence → `tf-connectors` + `tf-core/pipeline`\n- Anomaly Mgmt → `tf-core/domain` + `tf-llm` (génération brouillons) + `tf-cli/commands/anomalies.rs`\n- Reporting → `tf-core/domain/report` + `tf-export` (Excel/PPT) + `tf-cli/commands/report.rs`\n- Config/Reuse → `tf-config`\n- Compliance/Safety → `tf-security`, `tf-logging`, `tf-diagnostics`\n- LLM Integration → `tf-llm` (local prioritaire, cloud fallback avec anonymisation via `tf-security`)\n\n### Integration Points\n\n**Internal Communication:**\n- `tf-cli` → `tf-core` orchestrates\n- `tf-core` → `tf-connectors` for external data\n- `tf-core` → `tf-storage` for cache\n- `tf-core` → `tf-security` for anonymisation\n- `tf-core` → `tf-llm` for AI-assisted generation\n- `tf-core` → `tf-export` for document generation\n- `tf-llm` → `tf-security` for anonymisation before cloud calls\n\n**External Integrations:**\n- Jira/Squash/SharePoint via `tf-connectors`\n- CSV import/export via `tf-connectors/csv.rs`\n- LLM local (Ollama) via `tf-llm/local.rs`\n- LLM cloud (OpenAI-compatible) via `tf-llm/cloud.rs`\n\n**Data Flow:**\nCLI → Core Pipeline → Connectors/Storage → LLM (optional) → Export → Domain Outputs → CLI Output\n\n### File Organization Patterns\n\n**Configuration Files:**\n- `.env.example` at root\n- `config.yaml` loaded via `tf-config`\n\n**Source Organization:**\n- crate boundaries define ownership\n\n**Test Organization:**\n- integration tests in `tests/integration`\n\n**Asset Organization:**\n- `assets/templates/` for Office templates (xlsx, pptx, md)\n- Templates are versioned with the codebase\n- User-customizable templates can override defaults via config\n\n### Development Workflow Integration\n\n**Development Server Structure:**\n- N/A (CLI)\n\n**Build Process Structure:**\n- Workspace builds all crates; `tf-cli` produces final binary\n\n**Deployment Structure:**\n- CI builds `tf-cli` per OS; npm wrapper downloads binaries\n\n\n## Architecture Validation Results\n\n### Coherence Validation ✅\n\n**Decision Compatibility:**\nLes choix sont compatibles : Rust CLI + workspace, SQLite local chiffré applicativement, secrets via keyring, logs JSON, intégrations REST + fallback CSV, CI GitHub Actions, distribution npm wrapper.\n\n**Pattern Consistency:**\nLes conventions de nommage/structure/format/logs sont alignées avec la stack Rust et les exigences de conformité.\n\n**Structure Alignment:**\nLa structure multi-crates isole bien connecteurs, sécurité, stockage, diagnostics et CLI, réduisant les conflits entre agents.\n\n### Requirements Coverage Validation ✅\n\n**Epic/Feature Coverage:**\nN/A (pas d'epics, mapping par catégories FR).\n\n**Functional Requirements Coverage:**\nToutes les catégories FR sont couvertes : ingestion/triage, génération, exécution, anomalies, reporting, config et réutilisation.\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements Coverage:**\nPrivacy/anonymisation, secret store, least privilege, audit logs, purge locale, performance CLI, mode dégradé, fiabilité/replay sont tous adressés.\n\n### Implementation Readiness Validation ✅\n\n**Decision Completeness:**\nDécisions critiques documentées avec versions (SQLite 3.51.1, keyring 3.6.2).\n\n**Structure Completeness:**\nArborescence complète multi-crates + tests + docs.\n\n**Pattern Completeness:**\nNommage, structure, formats, erreurs, retry, logs, diagnostics sont définis.\n\n### Gap Analysis Results\n\n- **Critical gaps:** none (LLM architecture et Office

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

L’utilisateur n’a plus qu’à relire et ajuster rapidement.\n\n### Platform Strategy\n\nUX CLI uniquement, avec un mode interactif guidé et un mode batch pour les usages récurrents. Prévoir un mode dégradé lorsque les APIs ne sont pas disponibles (fallback via imports/exports CSV).\n\n### Effortless Interactions\n\n- Pré‑remplissage automatique des templates (CR, anomalies).\n- Checklist de testabilité simple avec score instantané Go/Clarify/No‑Go.\n- Liaison automatique preuves ↔ tickets ↔ anomalies.\n\n### Critical Success Moments\n\n- Pré-remplissage automatique du CR < 2 minutes (partie système).\n- Le CR est généré et prêt en moins de 5 minutes, avec un haut niveau de confiance.\n- Un ticket passe clairement “ready” ou “à clarifier” dès le triage.\n\n### Experience Principles\n\n- **Un run = un résultat** : une action simple qui prépare 80% du travail quotidien.\n- **Guidé et rassurant** : l’UX CLI élimine les doutes avec un flux clair.\n- **Zéro double saisie** : la donnée circule automatiquement entre sources et livrables.\n- **Fiabilité visible** : l’utilisateur voit ce qui vient d’où, et peut valider rapidement.\n\n## Desired Emotional Response\n\n### Primary Emotional Goals\n\nL’outil doit faire ressentir au testeur : **soulagement**, **contrôle**, **confiance** et **efficacité**.  \nL’efficacité est l’émotion clé qui déclenche la recommandation à un collègue.\n\n### Emotional Journey Mapping\n\n- **Premier contact** : rassuré, car tout est clair et simple.\n- **Pendant le run** : en contrôle, grâce à une progression visible.\n- **Après la tâche** : soulagé et efficace, avec un gain de temps évident.\n- **En cas d’erreur** : calme et guidé, avec des solutions immédiates.\n\n### Micro-Emotions\n\n- **Confiance** (plutôt que confusion)\n- **Calme** (plutôt que anxiété)\n- **Fierté d’accomplissement** (plutôt que frustration)\n- **Satisfaction** (plutôt que doute)\n\n### Design Implications\n\n- Transparence sur l’état et les sources → renforce la confiance.\n- Progression claire et feedback continus → maintient le contrôle.\n- Résultats rapides et visibles → amplifient le soulagement et l’efficacité.\n- Messages d’erreur actionnables → évitent l’anxiété.\n\n### Emotional Design Principles\n\n- **Clarté avant tout** : réduire l’incertitude à chaque étape.\n- **Contrôle visible** : toujours montrer “où on en est”.\n- **Efficacité perceptible** : gains de temps concrets, immédiatement visibles.\n- **Assistance calme** : guider sans culpabiliser.\n\n## UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration\n\n### Inspiring Products Analysis\n\n- **Claude Code** : guidance pas à pas et ton rassurant → confiance et sentiment de contrôle.\n- **Codex** : intentions simples → exécution rapide, feedback clair, erreurs pragmatiques.\n- **GitHub CLI / Stripe CLI** : syntaxe prévisible, help contextuel, messages concis → flux “happy path” très fluide.\n- **lazygit / fzf** : vitesse, recherche instantanée, actions contextualisées → efficacité perçue.\n- **Notion / Airtable / Google Sheets** : modèles réutilisables et structure claire → standardisation et gain de temps.\n- **Linear / Jira (bien configuré)** : champs structurés, priorités visibles → triage rapide et décision claire.\n\n### Transferable UX Patterns\n\n- **Navigation** : commandes simples + sous-commandes prévisibles, avec aide contextuelle.\n- **Interaction** : “next best action” explicite après chaque étape.\n- **Feedback** : retour immédiat, concis, orienté résultat.\n- **Templates** : modèles prêts à l’emploi pour CR/anomalies.\n- **Recherche** : filtres rapides et sélection assistée (à la fzf).\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- Surcharge d’options dès le départ (trop de flags, trop de choix).\n- Logs verbeux qui masquent l’état réel.\n- Messages d’erreur vagues qui n’indiquent pas quoi faire.\n- Obliger l’utilisateur à re-saisir des données déjà connues.\n\n### Design Inspiration Strategy\n\n**À adopter**\n- Guidance pas à pas et “next action” (Claude Code).\n- Feedback court et actionnable (Codex, Stripe CLI).\n- Templates de travail prêts à l’emploi (Notion/Airtable).\n\n**À adapter**\n- Recherche rapide type fzf pour sélectionner tickets/lot.\n- Modèle de triage structuré comme Linear/Jira, mais simplifié.\n\n**À éviter**\n- Complexité initiale et surcharge d’options.\n- Verbosité non utile et erreurs non actionnables.\n\n## Design System Foundation\n\n### 1.1 Design System Choice\n\n**Approche : Système d’interaction CLI sur mesure, basé sur des patterns établis**  \nUn système “custom léger” : commandes et feedbacks uniques, mais inspirés des meilleures pratiques CLI (aide contextuelle, messages concis, guidance pas à pas).\n\n### Rationale for Selection\n\n- **Unicité + équilibre** : identité propre sans sur-investir dans un design visuel lourd.\n- **Aucune charte existante** : liberté pour définir des patterns simples et cohérents.\n- **Niveau UX faible** : s’appuyer sur des patterns éprouvés pour éviter les pièges.\n- **Pas de deadline** : possibilité d’affiner progressivement.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Définir un “pattern book” CLI : structure de commande, réponses, erreurs, confirmations, progression.\n- Standardiser les messages (succès, warning, erreur) et la hiérarchie des infos.\n- Documenter les flows essentiels : run quotidien, triage, anomalies, reporting.\n\n### Customization Strategy\n\n- Ton et wording rassurants, cohérents avec l’émotion cible (contrôle, efficacité).\n- Templates de sortie ajustables (CR/anomalies).\n- Variables de configuration pour adapter les comportements (profil, verbose, dry-run).\n\n## 2. Core User Experience\n\n### 2.1 Defining Experience\n\nL’expérience signature, c’est un **run unique** qui collecte Jira/Squash/Excel, applique la checklist, puis génère un CR quotidien et des brouillons d’anomalies prêts à relire. L’utilisateur résume l’outil ainsi : “je lance, je relis, j’envoie”.\n\n### 2.2 User Mental Model\n\nAujourd’hui, le testeur jongle entre plusieurs outils, fait des exports manuels, nettoie, met en forme, puis envoie. Son modèle mental est “assembler des éléments dispersés” et “copier-coller pour produire le reporting”.\n\n### 2.3 Success Criteria\n\n- Pre-remplissage automatique du CR < 2 minutes (partie systeme).\n- CR prêt en < 5 minutes après le run (relecture/ajustements inclus).\n- Checklist appliquée et explicite (Go/Clarify/No-Go).\n- Zéro re-saisie des données déjà présentes.\n- Résultats jugés fiables et exploitables dès la première relecture.\n\n### 2.4 Novel UX Patterns\n\nLe cœur reste **familier** (CLI + commandes guidées), avec une innovation légère : un run unique qui orchestre tout et propose la “next best action”. Pas de pattern radicalement nouveau, mais une combinaison fluide et rassurante.\n\n### 2.5 Experience Mechanics\n\n**1. Initiation**  \nCommande simple (`run` ou alias), avec un prompt clair et des options minimales.\n\n**2. Interaction**  \nLe système collecte les sources, applique la checklist, prépare CR/anomalies, et affiche la progression.\n\n**3. Feedback**  \nMessages courts, état visible, et recommandations d’action (corriger, valider, envoyer).\n\n**4. Completion**  \nSorties prêtes à usage (CR, anomalies) + récapitulatif des actions effectuées.\n\n## Visual Design Foundation\n\n*Note : ces fondations visuelles s'appliquent aux sorties basées sur templates existants (CR/PPT/anomalies) et a la documentation, sans personnalisation visuelle hors template.*\n\n### Color System\n\n**Thème : Pro-Calme (bleu/gris)**  \nPalette de base orientée confiance et calme, avec une accentuation claire des états.\n\n- **Primary** : bleu profond (confiance, stabilité)\n- **Neutrals** : gris neutres clairs/foncés pour hiérarchie lisible\n- **Success** : vert doux (validation, “tout est OK”)\n- **Warning** : ambre discret (attention sans stress)\n- **Error** : rouge contrôlé (clarté sans agressivité)\n\n### Typography System\n\n**Pairing recommandé : IBM Plex**  \n- **Monospace (CLI / outputs)** : IBM Plex Mono  \n- **Sans (docs / reporting)** : IBM Plex Sans  \nHiérarchie simple, lisible, professionnelle, avec un ton sobre.\n\n### Spacing & Layout Foundation\n\n- **Densité respirée** : lignes et blocs bien séparés pour éviter la fatigue cognitive.\n- **Base spacing** : échelle 8px (ou équivalent dans le rendu doc).\n- **Hiérarchie claire** : titres, sections, listes, et états facilement repérables.\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\n- Contrastes élevés pour lisibilité en terminal et dans la doc.\n- Couleurs d’état doublées par libellés explicites (pas de dépendance au seul code couleur).\n- Taille de texte confortable pour lecture prolongée.\n\n## Design Direction Decision\n\n### Design Directions Explored\n\n- Guided Run (calme, progression claire)\n- Split View (contrôle + preuves visibles)\n- Minimal Batch (vitesse maximale)\n- Template Studio (structure et templates)\n- KPI Snapshot (confiance via indicateurs)\n- Gentle Coach (guidé, rassurant)\n\n### Chosen Direction\n\n**Direction 1: Guided Run (Calm Focus)**  \nUne interface centrée sur un run guidé, avec progression visible, feedback concis, et “next action” explicite.\n\n### Design Rationale\n\n- Alignement direct avec les émotions cibles : contrôle, confiance, soulagement, efficacité.\n- Favorise un “happy path” clair et réduit la charge mentale.\n- Compatible avec utilisateurs CLI novices à intermédiaires.\n- S’inscrit dans le pattern “run unique” défini comme interaction signature.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Pipeline de run en 4 étapes (collecte → checklist → génération → review).\n- États visibles + feedback court (OK/Warn/Error).\n- “Next action” systématique en fin de run (ex: review, send, export).\n\n## User Journey Flows\n\n### 1) Run quotidien complet (collecte → checklist → CR → review)\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Start: tf run --daily] --> B[Collect sources Jira/Squash/Excel]\n

progression à chaque étape.\n- Erreurs actionnables avec proposition de recovery.\n\n## Component Strategy\n\n### Design System Components\n\nSystème d’interaction CLI “custom léger” basé sur patterns éprouvés :\n- Command prompt + help contextuel\n- Progress indicator (étapes + %)\n- Status line (OK / WARN / ERROR)\n- Summary block (résumé des actions)\n- Next-action suggestion\n\n### Custom Components\n\n#### Run Pipeline Summary\n**Purpose:** synthèse du run (collecte → checklist → génération → review)\n**States:** running / success / warning / error / degraded\n**Interaction:** affiche la prochaine action\n**Degraded Mode Display:**\n- Indicateur visuel `[DEGRADED]` en orange si une source est en fallback CSV\n- Liste des sources OK vs fallback (ex: `Jira: OK | Squash: CSV fallback`)\n- Message explicite : \"Mode dégradé actif – certaines données proviennent d'imports manuels\"\n\n#### Checklist Result Panel\n**Purpose:** Go/Clarify/No-Go + raisons  \n**States:** success / warning / error  \n**Variants:** par périmètre / lot\n\n#### Anomaly Draft Template\n**Purpose:** standardiser les anomalies  \n**Content:** contexte, repro, preuve, impact  \n**Interaction:** validation avant publication\n\n#### Evidence Linker\n**Purpose:** lier preuves SharePoint ↔ tickets  \n**States:** linked / missing / error  \n**Interaction:** propose correction si lien manquant\n\n#### Report Output Preview\n**Purpose:** aperçu CR/PPT avant export  \n**Interaction:** quick review + edit\n\n#### Ticket Picker\n**Purpose:** sélection rapide par périmètre/lot  \n**Interaction:** recherche instantanée type fzf\n\n#### Diff/Delta Viewer\n**Purpose:** afficher ce qui a changé depuis la dernière exécution  \n**Interaction:** focus sur écarts clés\n\n#### Error Recovery Card\n**Purpose:** diagnostic + action recommandée  \n**States:** recoverable / blocked\n\n#### Config Validator\n**Purpose:** vérifier sources/credentials avant run  \n**Interaction:** liste de checks + statut\n\n#### Export Router\n**Purpose:** choix rapide format + destination  \n**Variants:** md/csv/ppt + SharePoint/Outlook/local\n\n#### Dry-Run Preview\n**Purpose:** simuler les actions avant exécution\n**Interaction:** affiche l'impact sans modification\n\n#### Privacy & LLM Mode Indicator\n**Purpose:** afficher le mode de traitement IA et le niveau de confidentialité actif\n**States:** local / cloud-anonymized / disabled\n**Display:**\n- `[LLM: LOCAL]` en vert – traitement 100% local\n- `[LLM: CLOUD ✓]` en bleu – cloud avec anonymisation active\n- `[LLM: OFF]` en gris – mode sans IA\n**Interaction:** visible dans la status line pendant les opérations IA\n**Couvre FR28-FR31 du PRD :**\n- FR28 : Anonymisation automatique visible\n- FR29 : Mode LLM local clairement identifié\n- FR30 : Journalisation sans données sensibles (implicite)\n- FR31 : Gestion secrets (configuration, pas UX directe)\n\n#### Test Design Assistant Panel\n**Purpose:** guider la conception de cas de test assistée par IA\n**States:** loading / draft-ready / validated / exported\n**Content:** stratégie de test, cas nominaux, variantes, limites\n**Interaction:** édition inline + validation avant export Squash\n**Couvre FR6-FR9 du PRD**\n\n### Component Implementation Strategy\n\n- Standardiser tous les composants avec les mêmes patterns d’état.\n- Messages courts et actionnables, cohérents avec le ton “calme/pro”.\n- Utiliser les tokens de la fondation visuelle (couleurs états + typo).\n\n### Implementation Roadmap\n\n**Phase 1 (core)**\n- Run Pipeline Summary (avec mode dégradé), Checklist Result Panel, Summary block, Next-action suggestion.\n- Privacy & LLM Mode Indicator (visible dès le premier run).\n\n**Phase 2 (ops)**\n- Evidence Linker, Anomaly Draft Template, Report Output Preview.\n- Test Design Assistant Panel (conception assistée FR6-FR9).\n\n**Phase 3 (power)**\n- Ticket Picker, Diff/Delta Viewer, Error Recovery Card, Export Router, Dry-Run Preview, Config Validator.\n\n## UX Consistency Patterns\n\n### Button Hierarchy (CLI Actions)\n\n- **Primary action** : commande directe (ex: `tf run`)\n- **Secondary action** : option explicite (ex: `--review`, `--export`)\n- **Confirmation** : uniquement pour actions irréversibles (ex: `--publish`)\n- **Default** : toujours visible et sûr (no destructive by default)\n\n### Feedback Patterns\n\n- **Success** : message court + résultat (OK)\n- **Warning** : cause + action recommandée\n- **Error** : diagnostic + “next best action”\n- **Info** : état ou progression sans bruit\n\n### Form Patterns (Prompts & Inputs)\n\n- Prompts courts, un par ligne\n- Valeurs par défaut visibles\n- Champs requis explicités\n- Validation immédiate avec message correctif\n\n### Navigation Patterns\n\n- Commandes hiérarchiques : `tf <module> <action>`\n- Help contextuel : `tf <module> --help`\n- “Next action” proposé en fin de flow\n\n### Search & Filtering Patterns\n\n- Sélection rapide type fzf\n- Filtres par périmètre / lot / statut\n- Résumé de sélection avant exécution\n\n### Additional Patterns\n\n**Empty States & Loading**  \n- État vide explicite + action possible  \n- Chargement : étapes visibles et durée estimée\n\n**Errors & Recovery**  \n- Diagnostic en 2 lignes max  \n- Option de replay  \n- Mode dégradé proposé si API indisponibles\n\n## Responsive Design & Accessibility\n\n### Responsive Strategy\n\n- **Desktop-first** : usage principal sur poste de travail (terminal).\n- **Mobile/tablette hors scope** pour l’interface CLI.\n- Pour la doc/outputs web, priorité aux écrans ≥ 1024px.\n\n### Breakpoint Strategy\n\n- CLI : non applicable (terminal).\n- Docs/rapports web : breakpoint principal à 1024px+, avec fallback simple pour écrans plus petits.\n\n### Accessibility Strategy\n\n- **WCAG AA** pour documentation et outputs.\n- Contraste élevé et états visibles sans dépendance à la couleur.\n- Navigation clavier complète (par définition en CLI).\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n- Vérifier contrastes (AA) pour outputs/doc.\n- Tests de lisibilité en terminal (thèmes clairs/sombres).\n- Tests clavier & copie/collé sur outputs.\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\n- Messages courts, hiérarchie claire.\n- Couleurs d'état doublées par libellés.\n- Éviter les symboles ambigus sans texte.\n\n---\n\n## Revision History\n\n| Date | Version | Changes

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
