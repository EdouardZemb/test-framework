You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"},"git":{}}}

Check for Existing Workflow\n\nFirst, check if the output document already exists:\n\n- Look for file at `{planning_artifacts}/*ux-design-specification*.md`\n- If exists, read the complete file including frontmatter\n- If not exists, this is a fresh workflow\n\n### 2. Handle Continuation (If Document Exists)\n\nIf the document exists and has frontmatter with `stepsCompleted`:\n\n- **STOP here** and load `./step-01b-continue.md` immediately\n- Do not proceed with any initialization tasks\n- Let step-01b handle the continuation logic\n\n### 3. Fresh Workflow Setup (If No Document)\n\nIf no document exists or no `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter:\n\n#### A. Input Document Discovery\n\nDiscover and load context documents using smart discovery. Documents can be in the following locations:\n- {planning_artifacts}/**\n- {output_folder}/**\n- {product_knowledge}/**\n- docs/**\n\nAlso - when searching - documents can be a single markdown file, or a folder with an index and multiple files. For Example, if searching for `*foo*.md` and not found, also search for a folder called *foo*/index.md (which indicates sharded content)\n\nTry to discover the following:\n- Product Brief (`*brief*.md`)\n- Research Documents (`*prd*.md`)\n- Project Documentation (generally multiple documents might be found for this in the `{product_knowledge}` or `docs` folder.)\n- Project Context (`**/project-context.md`)\n\n<critical>Confirm what you have found with the user, along with asking if the user wants to provide anything else. Only after this confirmation will you proceed to follow the loading rules</critical>\n\n**Loading Rules:**\n\n- Load ALL discovered files completely that the user confirmed or provided (no offset/limit)\n- If there is a project context, whatever is relevant should try to be biased in the remainder of this whole workflow process\n- For sharded folders, load ALL files to get complete picture, using the index first to potentially know the potential of each document\n- index.md is a guide to what's relevant whenever available\n- Track all successfully loaded files in frontmatter `inputDocuments` array\n\n#### B. Create Initial Document\n\nCopy the template from `{installed_path}/ux-design-template.md` to `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-specification.md`\nInitialize frontmatter in the template.\n\n#### C. Complete Initialization and Report\n\nComplete setup and report to user:\n\n**Document Setup:**\n\n- Created: `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-specification.md` from template\n- Initialized frontmatter with workflow state\n\n**Input Documents Discovered:**\nReport what was found:\n\"Welcome {{user_name}}! I've set up your UX design workspace for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Documents Found:**\n\n- PRD: {number of PRD files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Product brief: {number of brief files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Other context: {number of other files loaded or \"None found\"}\n\n**Files loaded:** {list of specific file names or \"No additional documents found\"}\n\nDo you have any other documents you'd like me to include, or shall we continue to the next step?\n\n[C] Continue to UX discovery\"\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects [C] to continue, ensure the file `{planning_artifacts}/ux-design-specification.md` has been created and saved, and then load `./step-02-discovery.md` to begin the UX discovery phase.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-02 until output file has been updated and user explicitly selects [C] to continue!\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Existing workflow detected and handed off to step-01b correctly\n✅ Fresh workflow initialized with template and frontmatter\n✅ Input documents discovered and loaded using sharded-first logic\n✅ All discovered files tracked in frontmatter `inputDocuments`\n✅ User confirmed document setup and can proceed\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Proceeding with fresh initialization when existing workflow exists\n❌ Not updating frontmatter with discovered input documents\n❌ Creating document without proper template\n❌ Not checking sharded folders first before whole files\n❌ Not reporting what documents were found to user\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

L’utilisateur n’a plus qu’à relire et ajuster rapidement.\n\n### Platform Strategy\n\nUX CLI uniquement, avec un mode interactif guidé et un mode batch pour les usages récurrents. Prévoir un mode dégradé lorsque les APIs ne sont pas disponibles (fallback via imports/exports CSV).\n\n### Effortless Interactions\n\n- Pré‑remplissage automatique des templates (CR, anomalies).\n- Checklist de testabilité simple avec score instantané Go/Clarify/No‑Go.\n- Liaison automatique preuves ↔ tickets ↔ anomalies.\n\n### Critical Success Moments\n\n- Le CR est généré et prêt en moins de 5 minutes, avec un haut niveau de confiance.\n- Un ticket passe clairement “ready” ou “à clarifier” dès le triage.\n\n### Experience Principles\n\n- **Un run = un résultat** : une action simple qui prépare 80% du travail quotidien.\n- **Guidé et rassurant** : l’UX CLI élimine les doutes avec un flux clair.\n- **Zéro double saisie** : la donnée circule automatiquement entre sources et livrables.\n- **Fiabilité visible** : l’utilisateur voit ce qui vient d’où, et peut valider rapidement.\n\n## Desired Emotional Response\n\n### Primary Emotional Goals\n\nL’outil doit faire ressentir au testeur : **soulagement**, **contrôle**, **confiance** et **efficacité**.  \nL’efficacité est l’émotion clé qui déclenche la recommandation à un collègue.\n\n### Emotional Journey Mapping\n\n- **Premier contact** : rassuré, car tout est clair et simple.\n- **Pendant le run** : en contrôle, grâce à une progression visible.\n- **Après la tâche** : soulagé et efficace, avec un gain de temps évident.\n- **En cas d’erreur** : calme et guidé, avec des solutions immédiates.\n\n### Micro-Emotions\n\n- **Confiance** (plutôt que confusion)\n- **Calme** (plutôt que anxiété)\n- **Fierté d’accomplissement** (plutôt que frustration)\n- **Satisfaction** (plutôt que doute)\n\n### Design Implications\n\n- Transparence sur l’état et les sources → renforce la confiance.\n- Progression claire et feedback continus → maintient le contrôle.\n- Résultats rapides et visibles → amplifient le soulagement et l’efficacité.\n- Messages d’erreur actionnables → évitent l’anxiété.\n\n### Emotional Design Principles\n\n- **Clarté avant tout** : réduire l’incertitude à chaque étape.\n- **Contrôle visible** : toujours montrer “où on en est”.\n- **Efficacité perceptible** : gains de temps concrets, immédiatement visibles.\n- **Assistance calme** : guider sans culpabiliser.\n\n## UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration\n\n### Inspiring Products Analysis\n\n- **Claude Code** : guidance pas à pas et ton rassurant → confiance et sentiment de contrôle.\n- **Codex** : intentions simples → exécution rapide, feedback clair, erreurs pragmatiques.\n- **GitHub CLI / Stripe CLI** : syntaxe prévisible, help contextuel, messages concis → flux “happy path” très fluide.\n- **lazygit / fzf** : vitesse, recherche instantanée, actions contextualisées → efficacité perçue.\n- **Notion / Airtable / Google Sheets** : modèles réutilisables et structure claire → standardisation et gain de temps.\n- **Linear / Jira (bien configuré)** : champs structurés, priorités visibles → triage rapide et décision claire.\n\n### Transferable UX Patterns\n\n- **Navigation** : commandes simples + sous-commandes prévisibles, avec aide contextuelle.\n- **Interaction** : “next best action” explicite après chaque étape.\n- **Feedback** : retour immédiat, concis, orienté résultat.\n- **Templates** : modèles prêts à l’emploi pour CR/anomalies.\n- **Recherche** : filtres rapides et sélection assistée (à la fzf).\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- Surcharge d’options dès le départ (trop de flags, trop de choix).\n- Logs verbeux qui masquent l’état réel.\n- Messages d’erreur vagues qui n’indiquent pas quoi faire.\n- Obliger l’utilisateur à re-saisir des données déjà connues.\n\n### Design Inspiration Strategy\n\n**À adopter**\n- Guidance pas à pas et “next action” (Claude Code).\n- Feedback court et actionnable (Codex, Stripe CLI).\n- Templates de travail prêts à l’emploi (Notion/Airtable).\n\n**À adapter**\n- Recherche rapide type fzf pour sélectionner tickets/lot.\n- Modèle de triage structuré comme Linear/Jira, mais simplifié.\n\n**À éviter**\n- Complexité initiale et surcharge d’options.\n- Verbosité non utile et erreurs non actionnables.\n\n## Design System Foundation\n\n### 1.1 Design System Choice\n\n**Approche : Système d’interaction CLI sur mesure, basé sur des patterns établis**  \nUn système “custom léger” : commandes et feedbacks uniques, mais inspirés des meilleures pratiques CLI (aide contextuelle, messages concis, guidance pas à pas).\n\n### Rationale for Selection\n\n- **Unicité + équilibre** : identité propre sans sur-investir dans un design visuel lourd.\n- **Aucune charte existante** : liberté pour définir des patterns simples et cohérents.\n- **Niveau UX faible** : s’appuyer sur des patterns éprouvés pour éviter les pièges.\n- **Pas de deadline** : possibilité d’affiner progressivement.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Définir un “pattern book” CLI : structure de commande, réponses, erreurs, confirmations, progression.\n- Standardiser les messages (succès, warning, erreur) et la hiérarchie des infos.\n- Documenter les flows essentiels : run quotidien, triage, anomalies, reporting.\n\n### Customization Strategy\n\n- Ton et wording rassurants, cohérents avec l’émotion cible (contrôle, efficacité).\n- Templates de sortie ajustables (CR/anomalies).\n- Variables de configuration pour adapter les comportements (profil, verbose, dry-run).\n\n## 2. Core User Experience\n\n### 2.1 Defining Experience\n\nL’expérience signature, c’est un **run unique** qui collecte Jira/Squash/Excel, applique la checklist, puis génère un CR quotidien et des brouillons d’anomalies prêts à relire. L’utilisateur résume l’outil ainsi : “je lance, je relis, j’envoie”.\n\n### 2.2 User Mental Model\n\nAujourd’hui, le testeur jongle entre plusieurs outils, fait des exports manuels, nettoie, met en forme, puis envoie. Son modèle mental est “assembler des éléments dispersés” et “copier-coller pour produire le reporting”.\n\n### 2.3 Success Criteria\n\n- CR prêt en < 5 minutes après le run.\n- Checklist appliquée et explicite (Go/Clarify/No-Go).\n- Zéro re-saisie des données déjà présentes.\n- Résultats jugés fiables et exploitables dès la première relecture.\n\n### 2.4 Novel UX Patterns\n\nLe cœur reste **familier** (CLI + commandes guidées), avec une innovation légère : un run unique qui orchestre tout et propose la “next best action”. Pas de pattern radicalement nouveau, mais une combinaison fluide et rassurante.\n\n### 2.5 Experience Mechanics\n\n**1. Initiation**  \nCommande simple (`run` ou alias), avec un prompt clair et des options minimales.\n\n**2. Interaction**  \nLe système collecte les sources, applique la checklist, prépare CR/anomalies, et affiche la progression.\n\n**3. Feedback**  \nMessages courts, état visible, et recommandations d’action (corriger, valider, envoyer).\n\n**4. Completion**  \nSorties prêtes à usage (CR, anomalies) + récapitulatif des actions effectuées.\n\n## Visual Design Foundation\n\n### Color System\n\n**Thème : Pro-Calme (bleu/gris)**  \nPalette de base orientée confiance et calme, avec une accentuation claire des états.\n\n- **Primary** : bleu profond (confiance, stabilité)\n- **Neutrals** : gris neutres clairs/foncés pour hiérarchie lisible\n- **Success** : vert doux (validation, “tout est OK”)\n- **Warning** : ambre discret (attention sans stress)\n- **Error** : rouge contrôlé (clarté sans agressivité)\n\n### Typography System\n\n**Pairing recommandé : IBM Plex**  \n- **Monospace (CLI / outputs)** : IBM Plex Mono  \n- **Sans (docs / reporting)** : IBM Plex Sans  \nHiérarchie simple, lisible, professionnelle, avec un ton sobre.\n\n### Spacing & Layout Foundation\n\n- **Densité respirée** : lignes et blocs bien séparés pour éviter la fatigue cognitive.\n- **Base spacing** : échelle 8px (ou équivalent dans le rendu doc).\n- **Hiérarchie claire** : titres, sections, listes, et états facilement repérables.\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\n- Contrastes élevés pour lisibilité en terminal et dans la doc.\n- Couleurs d’état doublées par libellés explicites (pas de dépendance au seul code couleur).\n- Taille de texte confortable pour lecture prolongée.\n\n## Design Direction Decision\n\n### Design Directions Explored\n\n- Guided Run (calme, progression claire)\n- Split View (contrôle + preuves visibles)\n- Minimal Batch (vitesse maximale)\n- Template Studio (structure et templates)\n- KPI Snapshot (confiance via indicateurs)\n- Gentle Coach (guidé, rassurant)\n\n### Chosen Direction\n\n**Direction 1: Guided Run (Calm Focus)**  \nUne interface centrée sur un run guidé, avec progression visible, feedback concis, et “next action” explicite.\n\n### Design Rationale\n\n- Alignement direct avec les émotions cibles : contrôle, confiance, soulagement, efficacité.\n- Favorise un “happy path” clair et réduit la charge mentale.\n- Compatible avec utilisateurs CLI novices à intermédiaires.\n- S’inscrit dans le pattern “run unique” défini comme interaction signature.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Pipeline de run en 4 étapes (collecte → checklist → génération → review).\n- États visibles + feedback court (OK/Warn/Error).\n- “Next action” systématique en fin de run (ex: review, send, export).\n\n## User Journey Flows\n\n### 1) Run quotidien complet (collecte → checklist → CR → review)\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Start: tf run --daily] --> B[Collect sources

FR6-FR9 du PRD :**\n- FR6 : Génération brouillon stratégie de test\n- FR7 : Propositions de cas de test (nominaux, variantes, limites)\n- FR8 : Édition et validation avant publication\n- FR9 : Intégration checklist ESN\n\n### Journey Patterns\n\n- **Pattern “Run + Next Action”** : chaque flow se termine par une action recommandée.\n- **Pattern “Check → Generate → Review”** : logique standard de qualité.\n- **Pattern “Fallback Graceful”** : dégradé via CSV/import quand APIs indisponibles.\n\n### Flow Optimization Principles\n\n- Réduire la saisie manuelle (zéro double saisie).\n- Afficher l’état et la progression à chaque étape.\n- Erreurs actionnables avec proposition de recovery.\n\n## Component Strategy\n\n### Design System Components\n\nSystème d’interaction CLI “custom léger” basé sur patterns éprouvés :\n- Command prompt + help contextuel\n- Progress indicator (étapes + %)\n- Status line (OK / WARN / ERROR)\n- Summary block (résumé des actions)\n- Next-action suggestion\n\n### Custom Components\n\n#### Run Pipeline Summary\n**Purpose:** synthèse du run (collecte → checklist → génération → review)\n**States:** running / success / warning / error / degraded\n**Interaction:** affiche la prochaine action\n**Degraded Mode Display:**\n- Indicateur visuel `[DEGRADED]` en orange si une source est en fallback CSV\n- Liste des sources OK vs fallback (ex: `Jira: OK | Squash: CSV fallback`)\n- Message explicite : \"Mode dégradé actif – certaines données proviennent d'imports manuels\"\n\n#### Checklist Result Panel\n**Purpose:** Go/Clarify/No-Go + raisons  \n**States:** success / warning / error  \n**Variants:** par périmètre / lot\n\n#### Anomaly Draft Template\n**Purpose:** standardiser les anomalies  \n**Content:** contexte, repro, preuve, impact  \n**Interaction:** validation avant publication\n\n#### Evidence Linker\n**Purpose:** lier preuves SharePoint ↔ tickets  \n**States:** linked / missing / error  \n**Interaction:** propose correction si lien manquant\n\n#### Report Output Preview\n**Purpose:** aperçu CR/PPT avant export  \n**Interaction:** quick review + edit\n\n#### Ticket Picker\n**Purpose:** sélection rapide par périmètre/lot  \n**Interaction:** recherche instantanée type fzf\n\n#### Diff/Delta Viewer\n**Purpose:** afficher ce qui a changé depuis la dernière exécution  \n**Interaction:** focus sur écarts clés\n\n#### Error Recovery Card\n**Purpose:** diagnostic + action recommandée  \n**States:** recoverable / blocked\n\n#### Config Validator\n**Purpose:** vérifier sources/credentials avant run  \n**Interaction:** liste de checks + statut\n\n#### Export Router\n**Purpose:** choix rapide format + destination  \n**Variants:** md/csv/ppt + SharePoint/Outlook/local\n\n#### Dry-Run Preview\n**Purpose:** simuler les actions avant exécution\n**Interaction:** affiche l'impact sans modification\n\n#### Privacy & LLM Mode Indicator\n**Purpose:** afficher le mode de traitement IA et le niveau de confidentialité actif\n**States:** local / cloud-anonymized / disabled\n**Display:**\n- `[LLM: LOCAL]` en vert – traitement 100% local\n- `[LLM: CLOUD ✓]` en bleu – cloud avec anonymisation active\n- `[LLM: OFF]` en gris – mode sans IA\n**Interaction:** visible dans la status line pendant les opérations IA\n**Couvre FR28-FR31 du PRD :**\n- FR28 : Anonymisation automatique visible\n- FR29 : Mode LLM local clairement identifié\n- FR30 : Journalisation sans données sensibles (implicite)\n- FR31 : Gestion secrets (configuration, pas UX directe)\n\n#### Test Design Assistant Panel\n**Purpose:** guider la conception de cas de test assistée par IA\n**States:** loading / draft-ready / validated / exported\n**Content:** stratégie de test, cas nominaux, variantes, limites\n**Interaction:** édition inline + validation avant export Squash\n**Couvre FR6-FR9 du PRD**\n\n### Component Implementation Strategy\n\n- Standardiser tous les composants avec les mêmes patterns d’état.\n- Messages courts et actionnables, cohérents avec le ton “calme/pro”.\n- Utiliser les tokens de la fondation visuelle (couleurs états + typo).\n\n### Implementation Roadmap\n\n**Phase 1 (core)**\n- Run Pipeline Summary (avec mode dégradé), Checklist Result Panel, Summary block, Next-action suggestion.\n- Privacy & LLM Mode Indicator (visible dès le premier run).\n\n**Phase 2 (ops)**\n- Evidence Linker, Anomaly Draft Template, Report Output Preview.\n- Test Design Assistant Panel (conception assistée FR6-FR9).\n\n**Phase 3 (power)**\n- Ticket Picker, Diff/Delta Viewer, Error Recovery Card, Export Router, Dry-Run Preview, Config Validator.\n\n## UX Consistency Patterns\n\n### Button Hierarchy (CLI Actions)\n\n- **Primary action** : commande directe (ex: `tf run`)\n- **Secondary action** : option explicite (ex: `--review`, `--export`)\n- **Confirmation** : uniquement pour actions irréversibles (ex: `--publish`)\n- **Default** : toujours visible et sûr (no destructive by default)\n\n### Feedback Patterns\n\n- **Success** : message court + résultat (OK)\n- **Warning** : cause + action recommandée\n- **Error** : diagnostic + “next best action”\n- **Info** : état ou progression sans bruit\n\n### Form Patterns (Prompts & Inputs)\n\n- Prompts courts, un par ligne\n- Valeurs par défaut visibles\n- Champs requis explicités\n- Validation immédiate avec message correctif\n\n### Navigation Patterns\n\n- Commandes hiérarchiques : `tf <module> <action>`\n- Help contextuel : `tf <module> --help`\n- “Next action” proposé en fin de flow\n\n### Search & Filtering Patterns\n\n- Sélection rapide type fzf\n- Filtres par périmètre / lot / statut\n- Résumé de sélection avant exécution\n\n### Additional Patterns\n\n**Empty States & Loading**  \n- État vide explicite + action possible  \n- Chargement : étapes visibles et durée estimée\n\n**Errors & Recovery**  \n- Diagnostic en 2 lignes max  \n- Option de replay  \n- Mode dégradé proposé si API indisponibles\n\n## Responsive Design & Accessibility\n\n### Responsive Strategy\n\n- **Desktop-first** : usage principal sur poste de travail (terminal).\n- **Mobile/tablette hors scope** pour l’interface CLI.\n- Pour la doc/outputs web, priorité aux écrans ≥ 1024px.\n\n### Breakpoint Strategy\n\n- CLI : non applicable (terminal).\n- Docs/rapports web : breakpoint principal à 1024px+, avec fallback simple pour écrans plus petits.\n\n### Accessibility Strategy\n\n- **WCAG AA** pour documentation et outputs.\n- Contraste élevé et états visibles sans dépendance à la couleur.\n- Navigation clavier complète (par définition en CLI).\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n- Vérifier contrastes (AA) pour outputs/doc.\n- Tests de lisibilité en terminal (thèmes clairs/sombres).\n- Tests clavier & copie/collé sur outputs.\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\n- Messages courts, hiérarchie claire.\n- Couleurs d'état doublées par libellés.\n- Éviter les symboles ambigus sans texte.\n\n---\n\n## Revision History\n\n| Date | Version | Changes |\n|------|---------|---------|\n| 2026-01-30 | 1.0 | Document initial complet (steps 1-14) |\n| 2026-01-30 | 1.1 | **Validation

Analyze Current State\n\nReview the frontmatter to understand:\n\n- `stepsCompleted`: Which steps are already done\n- `lastStep`: The most recently completed step number\n- `inputDocuments`: What context was already loaded\n- All other frontmatter variables\n\n### 2. Load All Input Documents\n\nReload the context documents listed in `inputDocuments`:\n\n- For each document in `inputDocuments`, load the complete file\n- This ensures you have full context for continuation\n- Don't discover new documents - only reload what was previously processed\n\n### 3. Summarize Current Progress\n\nWelcome the user back and provide context:\n\"Welcome back {{user_name}}! I'm resuming our UX design collaboration for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Current Progress:**\n\n- Steps completed: {stepsCompleted}\n- Last worked on: Step {lastStep}\n- Context documents available: {len(inputDocuments)} files\n- Current UX design specification is ready with all completed sections\n\n**Document Status:**\n\n- Current UX design document is ready with all completed sections\n- Ready to continue from where we left off\n\nDoes this look right, or do you want to make any adjustments before we proceed?\"\n\n### 4. Determine Next Step\n\nBased on `lastStep` value, determine which step to load next:\n\n- If `lastStep = 1` → Load `./step-02-discovery.md`\n- If `lastStep = 2` → Load `./step-03-core-experience.md`\n- If `lastStep = 3` → Load `./step-04-emotional-response.md`\n- Continue this pattern for all steps\n- If `lastStep` indicates final step → Workflow already complete\n\n### 5. Present Continuation Options\n\nAfter presenting current progress, ask:\n\"Ready to continue with Step {nextStepNumber}: {nextStepTitle}?\n\n[C] Continue to Step {nextStepNumber}\"\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ All previous input documents successfully reloaded\n✅ Current workflow state accurately analyzed and presented\n✅ User confirms understanding of progress\n✅ Correct next step identified and prepared for loading\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Discovering new input documents instead of reloading existing ones\n❌ Modifying content from already completed steps\n❌ Loading wrong next step based on `lastStep` value\n❌ Proceeding without user confirmation of current state\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## WORKFLOW ALREADY COMPLETE?\n\nIf `lastStep` indicates the final step is completed:\n\"Great news! It looks like we've already completed the UX design workflow for {{project_name}}.\n\nThe final UX design specification is ready at {output_folder}/ux-design-specification.md with all sections completed through step {finalStepNumber}.\n\nThe complete UX design includes visual foundations, user flows, and design specifications ready for implementation.\n\nWould you like me to:\n\n- Review the completed UX design specification with you\n- Suggest next workflow steps (like wireframe generation or architecture)\n- Start a new UX design revision\n\nWhat would be most helpful?\"\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user confirms they're ready to continue, load the appropriate next step file based on the `lastStep` value from frontmatter.\n\nRemember: Do NOT load the next step until user explicitly selects [C] to continue!\n"}}

The focus is on increasing process quality and reliability, reducing cognitive load, and improving reporting consistency, while keeping the existing toolset (Jira, Squash, Excel, PPT, Outlook, Teams, SharePoint).\n\n2) Why This Matters\nCurrent workflows rely on manual data transfers between tools, variable ticket quality, and high reporting effort. These factors reduce reliability and create unnecessary risk for test outcomes and stakeholder visibility. A more standardized and traceable process improves confidence, clarity, and decision-making.\n\n3) Objectives\nPrimary\n- Improve quality and reliability of preparation and reporting processes.\n- Standardize the way test inputs and outputs are handled.\n\nSecondary\n- Reduce mental load and repetitive manual work.\n- Improve traceability of tests, evidence, and anomalies.\n\n4) Scope (Phase 1)\nIn scope\n- Ticket readiness and testability qualification\n- Estimation and strategy validation\n- Standardized anomaly reporting\n- Daily and weekly reporting consistency\n\nOut of scope (Phase 1)\n- Full automation of test execution\n- Tool replacement or migration\n- Contractual process changes\n\n5) Key Challenges Observed\n- Ticket descriptions often lack clear acceptance criteria\n- Reporting requires manual copying and reformatting from multiple tools\n- Anomaly descriptions are inconsistent in format and detail\n- Reporting effort is high and varies by workload\n\n6) Expected Benefits\n- More reliable test planning and execution\n- Faster and more consistent reporting\n- Clearer anomaly documentation for analysis and fix cycles\n- Reduced risk of errors due to manual data transfer\n\n7) Proposed Direction (High-Level)\n- Introduce a testability checklist to ensure ticket readiness\n- Formalize validation of test strategy before design\n- Define a single source of truth for reporting metrics\n- Auto-populate daily and weekly reports where possible\n- Standardize anomaly templates and evidence linking\n\n8) Success Indicators\n- Higher % of tickets passing readiness checks before estimation\n- Reduced manual data entry points per report\n- Improved consistency of anomaly reports\n- Lower reporting error rate and improved timeliness\n\n9) Open Questions\n- Availability of API/export access for Jira and Squash\n- Acceptance of automated or scripted reporting support\n- Ownership for template and standard approvals\n\n10) Next Steps\n- Confirm constraints and access (APIs, exports, macros)\n- Agree on checklist, templates, and validation flow\n- Pilot on 1–2 perimeters before wider rollout\n"}}

The current process suffers from ambiguous ticket inputs, manual data transposition across tools, and inconsistent reporting standards. The target outcome is a reliable, standardized, traceable process that reduces cognitive load and improves output consistency, without changing the toolset.\n\n2) Background & Problem\nThe tester must manage multiple perimeters, perform estimation, create detailed test designs, execute tests, document evidence, and produce daily/weekly reports. Inputs (Jira tickets) often lack explicit acceptance criteria and require significant clarification. Reporting involves heavy manual extraction and re-entry into Excel and PPT, which causes errors and inconsistent outputs.\n\n3) Goals & Success Criteria\nPrimary Goals\n- Increase quality and reliability of test preparation and reporting.\n- Standardize inputs and outputs to reduce variability.\n\nSecondary Goals\n- Reduce cognitive load and manual effort.\n- Improve traceability across tests, evidence, anomalies, and reporting.\n\nSuccess Criteria (KPIs)\n- % tickets passing testability checklist before estimation\n- Reduction in manual data entry points per report\n- Template compliance rate for anomalies\n- Reporting error rate (mismatch/outdated metrics)\n- Reporting time per week (secondary KPI)\n\n4) Scope\nIn Scope (Priority)\nA) Preparation / Scoping\n- Testability qualification\n- Estimation standardization\n- Strategy validation\n- Reuse of existing test assets\n- Planning aligned with QA/HO cadence\n\nC) Reporting / CR\n- Weekly PPT reporting (fixed slide structure)\n- Daily CR reporting per perimeter\n- Final test/recipe reports + Jira comments\n\nOut of Scope (Phase 1)\n- Test execution automation\n- Tool replacement or migration\n- Contractual changes to client processes\n\n5) Users & Stakeholders\n- Primary User: QA Tester (TRA)\n- Stakeholders: CP (Project Manager), MOA, QA Lead / Pilot\n\n6) Current Workflow Summary\nPreparation / Scoping\n- Receive Jira tickets; estimate complexity and effort\n- Create estimates in Excel; align strategy with CP/MOA\n- Review Squash for reusable test cases\n- Align with QA and HO release cadence\n\nReporting\n- Weekly PPT: fixed slides with metrics, anomalies, priorities\n- Daily CR: Excel tables pasted into email\n- Recipe reports + Jira comment summarizing campaigns and evidence\n\n7) Pain Points\n- Ambiguous ticket inputs -> unreliable test design\n- Manual transposition across tools -> errors, inconsistencies\n- Lack of standardized anomaly template\n- Reporting burden -> cognitive overload\n- Environment availability disrupts flow\n\n8) Requirements\nFunctional Requirements\nFR1 - Testability Checklist & Score\nProvide a short checklist and numeric score for ticket readiness.\nOutput: Go / Clarify / No-Go.\n\nFR2 - Formal Strategy Validation\nIntroduce a visible approval step (CP/MOA) before design.\n\nFR3 - Single Source of Truth\nEach metric used in reports must derive from one authoritative source.\n\nFR4 - Automated Report Population\nDaily/weekly CR blocks are auto-filled from Jira/Squash/Excel.\n\nFR5 - Standardized Anomaly Template\nMandatory fields for clarity (context, repro, evidence, impact).\n\nFR6 - Evidence Traceability\nConsistent evidence naming + links in reports and tickets.\n\nFR7 - Calendar-Aware Planning\nHighlight risk against QA and HO cadence.\n\nFR8 - Test Asset Reuse Discovery\nAutomatically surface relevant test cases in Squash.\n\nNon-Functional Requirements\n- Must work with existing tools (Jira, Squash, Excel, PPT, Outlook, Teams, SharePoint)\n- Must respect fixed weekly PPT slide structure\n- Daily CR must hide empty sections\n- Minimal change management load for stakeholders\n\n9) User Stories (High-Level)\n1. As a tester, I want a testability checklist so I can decide whether a ticket is ready.\n2. As a tester, I want formal strategy validation to avoid testing unclear scope.\n3. As a tester, I want reports to auto-fill so I avoid manual retyping.\n4. As a CP, I want consistent weekly reports so I can trust the data.\n5. As a MOA, I want standardized anomaly reports for faster analysis.\n\n10) Constraints & Dependencies\n- Weekly report slide structure is fixed; only hidden if irrelevant.\n- Daily CR must exclude empty blocks.\n- API/export access to Jira/Squash may be required.\n- Stakeholder validation workflows must be accepted.\n\n11) Risks\n- Limited API access could reduce automation potential.\n- Change resistance to new templates or validation gates.\n- Over-engineering might increase workload if not streamlined.\n\n12) Open Questions\n- Are Jira/Squash APIs accessible, or only exports?\n- What KPI thresholds matter most to CP/MOA?\n- Are macros/scripts acceptable in the client environment?\n- Who approves new templates/standards?\n\n13) Milestones (Suggested)\nPhase 1 - Standardization (Quick Wins)\n- Testability checklist + anomaly template\n- Reporting source of truth definition\n\nPhase 2 - Automation\n- Auto-fill daily CR\n- PPT report data injection\n\nPhase 3 - Optimization\n- Asset reuse discovery\n- KPI dashboards and quality gates\n\n14) Requirements Prioritization\nP0 - Must Have (critical for quality and reliability)\n- FR1 - Testability Checklist & Score\n- FR2 - Formal Strategy Validation\n- FR3 - Single Source of Truth\n- FR5 - Standardized Anomaly Template\n- FR6 - Evidence Traceability\n\nP1 - Should Have (strong impact, but not blocking)\n- FR4 - Automated Report Population\n- FR7 - Calendar-Aware Planning\n- FR8 - Test Asset Reuse Discovery\n\nP2 - Nice to Have (optimization / future)\n- KPI dashboards beyond core KPIs\n- Advanced automation or AI-assisted ticket analysis\n- Cross-perimeter predictive planning\n"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Les emails sont tries rapidement, puis le weekly TRA aligne les priorites. Le planning mensuel te donne une trajectoire claire.\nEn phase devis, les tickets Jira passent par une checklist testabilite : ceux qui ne sont pas \"ready\" sont immediatement identifies. Un pipeline d'aide propose une extraction d'exigences et une strategie de tests structuree, que tu ajustes.\nEn conception, Squash est alimente par des propositions de cas de test pretes a relire, avec la checklist ESN integree.\nEn execution, tu lances la campagne ; les preuves video sont centralisees automatiquement et liees aux cas. Les anomalies se generent avec un template structure, preuves liees, et l'association Squash <-> Jira est fluide.\nEn fin de journee, le CR quotidien est pre-rempli (extraction Jira/Squash/Outlook), tu corriges et envoies en 5 minutes.\nLe mercredi, le PPT hebdo est pre-genere a partir des sources, tu ajustes les priorites et l'envoies.\nResultat : un rythme maitrise, une qualite percue superieure, et un effort mental reduit.\n\n### Journey 2 - Primary User - Edge Case \"jour qui deborde\"\nLe weekly deborde, les tickets sont volumineux et mal cadres. Tu risques la dispersion.\nLe systeme te ramene a un cadre industriel : tri automatique des tickets, alertes sur manque d'infos, actions proposees (clarification, demande MOA, report).\nIl suit la consommation de charge vs prevision, t'alerte avant la derive, et propose un plan de rattrapage (priorite, suspension, decalage).\nEn fin de journee, meme si tout part en vrille, le CR pre-rempli securise le rituel, evite le \"non-envoi\".\nResultat : tu gardes le controle, meme dans le chaos.\n\n### Journey 3 - Admin/Ops (toi) - Configuration et gouvernance\nTu ajustes les templates (anomalies, CR, PPT), les regles de checklist, les seuils KPI, et les sources de verite.\nTu ajoutes un nouveau perimetre, tu declares ses regles de nommage, et tu reutilises le pipeline existant.\nResultat : l'outillage est modulaire, maintenable, reutilisable.\n\n### Journey 4 - Support/Qualite - Investigation d'erreurs\nUne extraction ne colle pas. Tu consultes les logs de pipeline (quelle source, quelle transformation, quel mapping) et tu corriges.\nTu peux rejouer une extraction en mode diagnostic.\nResultat : transparence, fiabilite, et reduction des erreurs silencieuses.\n\n### Journey 5 - Reutilisation/Integration - Un autre projet branche la logique\nUn futur testeur clone le workflow, charge ses propres sources (Jira/Squash) et ses templates.\nLes modules sont interchangeables (reporting, checklist, anomalies, generation).\nResultat : transfert rapide, industrialisation multi-projets.\n\n### Journey 6 - TNR - Phase critique GO/NO-GO\nEn fin de lot, la campagne TNR est copiee et structuree automatiquement.\nLes anomalies TNR sont taguees, les preuves sont centralisees, et le PPT TNR est pre-rempli (GO/NO-GO, reserves, liens).\nResultat : decision finale plus fiable, moins de stress.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n- Pipeline d'extraction Jira/Squash/Outlook/Excel/PPT -> pre-remplissage CR et PPT\n- Checklist testabilite + scoring Go / Clarify / No-Go\n- Generation de brouillons (cas de tests, anomalies) avec LLM local\n- Tracabilite complete preuves <-> cas <-> anomalies <-> tickets\n- Modules reutilisables + configuration par projet\n- Logs/diagnostics et mode replay\n- Gestion charge vs prevision + alertes\n- Support TNR (campagne, tags, reporting GO/NO-GO)\n\n## Domain-Specific Requirements\n\n### Compliance & Regulatory\n- Usage IA sensible : LLM local prioritaire, cloud possible mais jamais sans anonymisation automatique.\n- Mecanisme d'anonymisation by design avant tout envoi vers un LLM cloud.\n- Aucune donnee sensible (clients finaux) ne doit sortir du perimetre sans masquage.\n\n### Regulatory Requirements (Assurance)\n- Conformite aux exigences assurance par juridiction (a confirmer avec le client).\n- Respect des politiques internes de conservation des preuves et livrables (duree, lieu, acces).\n- Journalisation minimale pour audit interne (qui, quand, quoi) sans donnees sensibles.\n\n### Risk Modeling (Assurance)\n- Hors scope du MVP : aucune decision actuarielle ni modele de risque automatique.\n- Si des indicateurs de risque sont ajoutes plus tard, ils doivent etre explicitement valides par le client.\n\n### Fraud Detection\n- Hors scope du MVP : aucune detection de fraude automatique.\n- Possibilite future de signaler des anomalies suspectes via tags standardises (sans decision automatique).\n\n### Reporting Compliance\n- Conformite aux formats de reporting attendus par le client (PPT, CR, TNR).\n- Traçabilite des rapports via stockage SharePoint et references Jira/Squash.\n\n### Technical Constraints\n- Jira : API token OK (hors VM).\n- Squash : Basic auth au depart (token a demander).\n- Least privilege : demarrage read-only, ecriture apres validation.\n- Secrets dans un coffre/secret store, jamais en clair.\n- HTTPS/TLS pour API ; Squash en HTTP probable (a faire evoluer).\n- Stockage au repos sur SharePoint ; donnees locales minimisees, chiffrees, purges.\n- Audit logs minimaux : horodatage, perimetre, version, statut, sans donnees sensibles.\n- Restrictions IT a confirmer : scripts signes/macros, droits install, proxy, appels externes.\n- Execution idealement sur environnement approuve (poste + M365), VM reservee aux applis testees.\n\n### Integration Requirements\n- Critiques : Jira + Squash (sources de verite), SharePoint (preuves/livrables), Excel & PowerPoint (CR + reporting).\n- Souhaitees : Outlook + Teams pour diffusion et recuperation d'infos reunions.\n- Jira : API OK, tokens OK.\n- Squash : API OK en Basic, token non dispo immediatement.\n\n### Risk Mitigations\n- Squash token manquant : demarrage en Basic, plan d'evolution.\n- Outlook/Teams API possiblement restreints : risque sur automatisation diffusion.\n- Cloud LLM : risque privacy -> anonymisation automatique + option LLM local.\n\n## Innovation & Novel Patterns\n\n### Detected Innovation Areas\n- Exploitation des preuves video pour detecter des ecarts avec les cas de test et proposer des ameliorations de redaction (priorite d'innovation).\n- LLM local integre au workflow : CLI conversationnel + etapes automatiques dans le pipeline selon le contexte.\n- Pipeline d'industrialisation reutilisable multi-projets (modules interchangeables).\n\n### Market Context & Competitive Landscape\n- Innovation interne : peu d'outillage TRA combine Jira/Squash/SharePoint et IA locale de maniere integree.\n- Differenciation via l'usage des preuves video pour ameliorer la qualite des cas de test.\n\n### Validation Approach\n- Prouver la valeur sur un lot pilote : reduction des erreurs de reporting et gain de temps sans perte de qualite.\n- Valider l'assistant LLM local sur un sous-ensemble de tickets et cas de test, avec relecture humaine obligatoire.\n- Valider la detection d'ecarts via preuves video sur un echantillon limite avant generalisation.\n\n### Risk Mitigation\n- Si l'IA video est trop complexe : fallback sur pipeline d'amelioration manuelle assistee.\n- Si l'IA locale est insuffisante : option cloud avec anonymisation automatique.\n- Si resistance au changement : activer en mode opt-in et comparer performances avant/apres.\n\n## CLI Tool Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n- Outil CLI interactif et scriptable, destine a industrialiser les flux QA (reporting, checklist, generation de brouillons).\n- Usage multi-projets avec profils et configuration reutilisable.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n- Modes d'execution : assistant interactif + batch/script.\n- Sorties multi-formats : texte, JSON, CSV, Markdown, HTML, YAML.\n- Separation stricte des secrets via secret store / env vars.\n\n### Command Structure\n- Commandes principales orientees workflow (triage, design, execute, report, tnr).\n- Sous-commandes pour extraction, generation, publication, diagnostics.\n\n### Output Formats\n- Selection via flag (--format

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
