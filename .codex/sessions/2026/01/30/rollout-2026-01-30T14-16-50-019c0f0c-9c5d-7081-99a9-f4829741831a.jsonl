You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"},"git":{}}}

Check for Existing Workflow\n\nFirst, check if the output document already exists:\n\n- Look for existing {planning_artifacts}/`*architecture*.md`\n- If exists, read the complete file(s) including frontmatter\n- If not exists, this is a fresh workflow\n\n### 2. Handle Continuation (If Document Exists)\n\nIf the document exists and has frontmatter with `stepsCompleted`:\n\n- **STOP here** and load `./step-01b-continue.md` immediately\n- Do not proceed with any initialization tasks\n- Let step-01b handle the continuation logic\n\n### 3. Fresh Workflow Setup (If No Document)\n\nIf no document exists or no `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter:\n\n#### A. Input Document Discovery\n\nDiscover and load context documents using smart discovery. Documents can be in the following locations:\n- {planning_artifacts}/**\n- {output_folder}/**\n- {product_knowledge}/**\n- docs/**\n\nAlso - when searching - documents can be a single markdown file, or a folder with an index and multiple files. For Example, if searching for `*foo*.md` and not found, also search for a folder called *foo*/index.md (which indicates sharded content)\n\nTry to discover the following:\n- Product Brief (`*brief*.md`)\n- Product Requirements Document (`*prd*.md`)\n- UX Design (`*ux-design*.md`) and other\n- Research Documents (`*research*.md`)\n- Project Documentation (generally multiple documents might be found for this in the `{product_knowledge}` or `docs` folder.)\n- Project Context (`**/project-context.md`)\n\n<critical>Confirm what you have found with the user, along with asking if the user wants to provide anything else. Only after this confirmation will you proceed to follow the loading rules</critical>\n\n**Loading Rules:**\n\n- Load ALL discovered files completely that the user confirmed or provided (no offset/limit)\n- If there is a project context, whatever is relevant should try to be biased in the remainder of this whole workflow process\n- For sharded folders, load ALL files to get complete picture, using the index first to potentially know the potential of each document\n- index.md is a guide to what's relevant whenever available\n- Track all successfully loaded files in frontmatter `inputDocuments` array\n\n#### B. Validate Required Inputs\n\nBefore proceeding, verify we have the essential inputs:\n\n**PRD Validation:**\n\n- If no PRD found: \"Architecture requires a PRD to work from. Please run the PRD workflow first or provide the PRD file path.\"\n- Do NOT proceed without PRD\n\n**Other Input that might exist:**\n\n- UX Spec: \"Provides UI/UX architectural requirements\"\n\n#### C. Create Initial Document\n\nCopy the template from `{installed_path}/architecture-decision-template.md` to `{planning_artifacts}/architecture.md`\n\n#### D. Complete Initialization and Report\n\nComplete setup and report to user:\n\n**Document Setup:**\n\n- Created: `{planning_artifacts}/architecture.md` from template\n- Initialized frontmatter with workflow state\n\n**Input Documents Discovered:**\nReport what was found:\n\"Welcome {{user_name}}! I've set up your Architecture workspace for {{project_name}}.\n\n**Documents Found:**\n\n- PRD: {number of PRD files loaded or \"None found - REQUIRED\"}\n- UX Design: {number of UX files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Research: {number of research files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Project docs: {number of project files loaded or \"None found\"}\n- Project context: {project_context_rules count of rules for AI agents found}\n\n**Files loaded:** {list of specific file names or \"No additional documents found\"}\n\nReady to begin architectural decision making. Do you have any other documents you'd like me to include?\n\n[C] Continue to project context analysis\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Existing workflow detected and handed off to step-01b correctly\n✅ Fresh workflow initialized with template and frontmatter\n✅ Input documents discovered and loaded using sharded-first logic\n✅ All discovered files tracked in frontmatter `inputDocuments`\n✅ PRD requirement validated and communicated\n✅ User confirmed document setup and can proceed\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Proceeding with fresh initialization when existing workflow exists\n❌ Not updating frontmatter with discovered input documents\n❌ Creating document without proper template\n❌ Not checking sharded folders first before whole files\n❌ Not reporting what documents were found to user\n❌ Proceeding without validating PRD requirement\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects [C] to continue, only after ensuring all the template output has been created, then load `./step-02-context.md` to analyze the project context and begin architectural decision making.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-02 until user explicitly selects [C] from the menu and setup is confirmed!\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Les emails sont tries rapidement, puis le weekly TRA aligne les priorites. Le planning mensuel te donne une trajectoire claire.\nEn phase devis, les tickets Jira passent par une checklist testabilite : ceux qui ne sont pas \"ready\" sont immediatement identifies. Un pipeline d'aide propose une extraction d'exigences et une strategie de tests structuree, que tu ajustes.\nEn conception, Squash est alimente par des propositions de cas de test pretes a relire, avec la checklist ESN integree.\nEn execution, tu lances la campagne ; les preuves video sont centralisees automatiquement et liees aux cas. Les anomalies se generent avec un template structure, preuves liees, et l'association Squash <-> Jira est fluide.\nEn fin de journee, le CR quotidien est pre-rempli (extraction Jira/Squash/Outlook), tu corriges et envoies en 5 minutes.\nLe mercredi, le PPT hebdo est pre-genere a partir des sources, tu ajustes les priorites et l'envoies.\nResultat : un rythme maitrise, une qualite percue superieure, et un effort mental reduit.\n\n### Journey 2 - Primary User - Edge Case \"jour qui deborde\"\nLe weekly deborde, les tickets sont volumineux et mal cadres. Tu risques la dispersion.\nLe systeme te ramene a un cadre industriel : tri automatique des tickets, alertes sur manque d'infos, actions proposees (clarification, demande MOA, report).\nIl suit la consommation de charge vs prevision, t'alerte avant la derive, et propose un plan de rattrapage (priorite, suspension, decalage).\nEn fin de journee, meme si tout part en vrille, le CR pre-rempli securise le rituel, evite le \"non-envoi\".\nResultat : tu gardes le controle, meme dans le chaos.\n\n### Journey 3 - Admin/Ops (toi) - Configuration et gouvernance\nTu ajustes les templates (anomalies, CR, PPT), les regles de checklist, les seuils KPI, et les sources de verite.\nTu ajoutes un nouveau perimetre, tu declares ses regles de nommage, et tu reutilises le pipeline existant.\nResultat : l'outillage est modulaire, maintenable, reutilisable.\n\n### Journey 4 - Support/Qualite - Investigation d'erreurs\nUne extraction ne colle pas. Tu consultes les logs de pipeline (quelle source, quelle transformation, quel mapping) et tu corriges.\nTu peux rejouer une extraction en mode diagnostic.\nResultat : transparence, fiabilite, et reduction des erreurs silencieuses.\n\n### Journey 5 - Reutilisation/Integration - Un autre projet branche la logique\nUn futur testeur clone le workflow, charge ses propres sources (Jira/Squash) et ses templates.\nLes modules sont interchangeables (reporting, checklist, anomalies, generation).\nResultat : transfert rapide, industrialisation multi-projets.\n\n### Journey 6 - TNR - Phase critique GO/NO-GO\nEn fin de lot, la campagne TNR est copiee et structuree automatiquement.\nLes anomalies TNR sont taguees, les preuves sont centralisees, et le PPT TNR est pre-rempli (GO/NO-GO, reserves, liens).\nResultat : decision finale plus fiable, moins de stress.\n\n### Journey Requirements Summary\n- Pipeline d'extraction Jira/Squash/Outlook/Excel/PPT -> pre-remplissage CR et PPT\n- Checklist testabilite + scoring Go / Clarify / No-Go\n- Generation de brouillons (cas de tests, anomalies) avec LLM local\n- Tracabilite complete preuves <-> cas <-> anomalies <-> tickets\n- Modules reutilisables + configuration par projet\n- Logs/diagnostics et mode replay\n- Gestion charge vs prevision + alertes\n- Support TNR (campagne, tags, reporting GO/NO-GO)\n\n## Domain-Specific Requirements\n\n### Compliance & Regulatory\n- Usage IA sensible : LLM local prioritaire, cloud possible mais jamais sans anonymisation automatique.\n- Mecanisme d'anonymisation by design avant tout envoi vers un LLM cloud.\n- Aucune donnee sensible (clients finaux) ne doit sortir du perimetre sans masquage.\n\n### Regulatory Requirements (Assurance)\n- Conformite aux exigences assurance par juridiction (a confirmer avec le client).\n- Respect des politiques internes de conservation des preuves et livrables (duree, lieu, acces).\n- Journalisation minimale pour audit interne (qui, quand, quoi) sans donnees sensibles.\n\n### Risk Modeling (Assurance)\n- Hors scope du MVP : aucune decision actuarielle ni modele de risque automatique.\n- Si des indicateurs de risque sont ajoutes plus tard, ils doivent etre explicitement valides par le client.\n\n### Fraud Detection\n- Hors scope du MVP : aucune detection de fraude automatique.\n- Possibilite future de signaler des anomalies suspectes via tags standardises (sans decision automatique).\n\n### Reporting Compliance\n- Conformite aux formats de reporting attendus par le client (PPT, CR, TNR).\n- Traçabilite des rapports via stockage SharePoint et references Jira/Squash.\n\n### Technical Constraints\n- Jira : API token OK (hors VM).\n- Squash : Basic auth au depart (token a demander).\n- Least privilege : demarrage read-only, ecriture apres validation.\n- Secrets dans un coffre/secret store, jamais en clair.\n- HTTPS/TLS pour API ; Squash en HTTP probable (a faire evoluer).\n- Stockage au repos sur SharePoint ; donnees locales minimisees, chiffrees, purges.\n- Audit logs minimaux : horodatage, perimetre, version, statut, sans donnees sensibles.\n- Restrictions IT a confirmer : scripts signes/macros, droits install, proxy, appels externes.\n- Execution idealement sur environnement approuve (poste + M365), VM reservee aux applis testees.\n\n### Integration Requirements\n- Critiques : Jira + Squash (sources de verite), SharePoint (preuves/livrables), Excel & PowerPoint (CR + reporting).\n- Souhaitees : Outlook + Teams pour diffusion et recuperation d'infos reunions.\n- Jira : API OK, tokens OK.\n- Squash : API OK en Basic, token non dispo immediatement.\n\n### Risk Mitigations\n- Squash token manquant : demarrage en Basic, plan d'evolution.\n- Outlook/Teams API possiblement restreints : risque sur automatisation diffusion.\n- Cloud LLM : risque privacy -> anonymisation automatique + option LLM local.\n\n## Innovation & Novel Patterns\n\n### Detected Innovation Areas\n- Exploitation des preuves video pour detecter des ecarts avec les cas de test et proposer des ameliorations de redaction (priorite d'innovation).\n- LLM local integre au workflow : CLI conversationnel + etapes automatiques dans le pipeline selon le contexte.\n- Pipeline d'industrialisation reutilisable multi-projets (modules interchangeables).\n\n### Market Context & Competitive Landscape\n- Innovation interne : peu d'outillage TRA combine Jira/Squash/SharePoint et IA locale de maniere integree.\n- Differenciation via l'usage des preuves video pour ameliorer la qualite des cas de test.\n\n### Validation Approach\n- Prouver la valeur sur un lot pilote : reduction des erreurs de reporting et gain de temps sans perte de qualite.\n- Valider l'assistant LLM local sur un sous-ensemble de tickets et cas de test, avec relecture humaine obligatoire.\n- Valider la detection d'ecarts via preuves video sur un echantillon limite avant generalisation.\n\n### Risk Mitigation\n- Si l'IA video est trop complexe : fallback sur pipeline d'amelioration manuelle assistee.\n- Si l'IA locale est insuffisante : option cloud avec anonymisation automatique.\n- Si resistance au changement : activer en mode opt-in et comparer performances avant/apres.\n\n## CLI Tool Specific Requirements\n\n### Project-Type Overview\n- Outil CLI interactif et scriptable, destine a industrialiser les flux QA (reporting, checklist, generation de brouillons).\n- Usage multi-projets avec profils et configuration reutilisable.\n\n### Technical Architecture Considerations\n- Modes d'execution : assistant interactif + batch/script.\n- Sorties multi-formats : texte, JSON, CSV, Markdown, HTML, YAML.\n- Separation stricte des secrets via secret store / env vars.\n\n### Command Structure\n- Commandes principales

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

L’utilisateur n’a plus qu’à relire et ajuster rapidement.\n\n### Platform Strategy\n\nUX CLI uniquement, avec un mode interactif guidé et un mode batch pour les usages récurrents. Prévoir un mode dégradé lorsque les APIs ne sont pas disponibles (fallback via imports/exports CSV).\n\n### Effortless Interactions\n\n- Pré‑remplissage automatique des templates (CR, anomalies).\n- Checklist de testabilité simple avec score instantané Go/Clarify/No‑Go.\n- Liaison automatique preuves ↔ tickets ↔ anomalies.\n\n### Critical Success Moments\n\n- Le CR est généré et prêt en moins de 5 minutes, avec un haut niveau de confiance.\n- Un ticket passe clairement “ready” ou “à clarifier” dès le triage.\n\n### Experience Principles\n\n- **Un run = un résultat** : une action simple qui prépare 80% du travail quotidien.\n- **Guidé et rassurant** : l’UX CLI élimine les doutes avec un flux clair.\n- **Zéro double saisie** : la donnée circule automatiquement entre sources et livrables.\n- **Fiabilité visible** : l’utilisateur voit ce qui vient d’où, et peut valider rapidement.\n\n## Desired Emotional Response\n\n### Primary Emotional Goals\n\nL’outil doit faire ressentir au testeur : **soulagement**, **contrôle**, **confiance** et **efficacité**.  \nL’efficacité est l’émotion clé qui déclenche la recommandation à un collègue.\n\n### Emotional Journey Mapping\n\n- **Premier contact** : rassuré, car tout est clair et simple.\n- **Pendant le run** : en contrôle, grâce à une progression visible.\n- **Après la tâche** : soulagé et efficace, avec un gain de temps évident.\n- **En cas d’erreur** : calme et guidé, avec des solutions immédiates.\n\n### Micro-Emotions\n\n- **Confiance** (plutôt que confusion)\n- **Calme** (plutôt que anxiété)\n- **Fierté d’accomplissement** (plutôt que frustration)\n- **Satisfaction** (plutôt que doute)\n\n### Design Implications\n\n- Transparence sur l’état et les sources → renforce la confiance.\n- Progression claire et feedback continus → maintient le contrôle.\n- Résultats rapides et visibles → amplifient le soulagement et l’efficacité.\n- Messages d’erreur actionnables → évitent l’anxiété.\n\n### Emotional Design Principles\n\n- **Clarté avant tout** : réduire l’incertitude à chaque étape.\n- **Contrôle visible** : toujours montrer “où on en est”.\n- **Efficacité perceptible** : gains de temps concrets, immédiatement visibles.\n- **Assistance calme** : guider sans culpabiliser.\n\n## UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration\n\n### Inspiring Products Analysis\n\n- **Claude Code** : guidance pas à pas et ton rassurant → confiance et sentiment de contrôle.\n- **Codex** : intentions simples → exécution rapide, feedback clair, erreurs pragmatiques.\n- **GitHub CLI / Stripe CLI** : syntaxe prévisible, help contextuel, messages concis → flux “happy path” très fluide.\n- **lazygit / fzf** : vitesse, recherche instantanée, actions contextualisées → efficacité perçue.\n- **Notion / Airtable / Google Sheets** : modèles réutilisables et structure claire → standardisation et gain de temps.\n- **Linear / Jira (bien configuré)** : champs structurés, priorités visibles → triage rapide et décision claire.\n\n### Transferable UX Patterns\n\n- **Navigation** : commandes simples + sous-commandes prévisibles, avec aide contextuelle.\n- **Interaction** : “next best action” explicite après chaque étape.\n- **Feedback** : retour immédiat, concis, orienté résultat.\n- **Templates** : modèles prêts à l’emploi pour CR/anomalies.\n- **Recherche** : filtres rapides et sélection assistée (à la fzf).\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- Surcharge d’options dès le départ (trop de flags, trop de choix).\n- Logs verbeux qui masquent l’état réel.\n- Messages d’erreur vagues qui n’indiquent pas quoi faire.\n- Obliger l’utilisateur à re-saisir des données déjà connues.\n\n### Design Inspiration Strategy\n\n**À adopter**\n- Guidance pas à pas et “next action” (Claude Code).\n- Feedback court et actionnable (Codex, Stripe CLI).\n- Templates de travail prêts à l’emploi (Notion/Airtable).\n\n**À adapter**\n- Recherche rapide type fzf pour sélectionner tickets/lot.\n- Modèle de triage structuré comme Linear/Jira, mais simplifié.\n\n**À éviter**\n- Complexité initiale et surcharge d’options.\n- Verbosité non utile et erreurs non actionnables.\n\n## Design System Foundation\n\n### 1.1 Design System Choice\n\n**Approche : Système d’interaction CLI sur mesure, basé sur des patterns établis**  \nUn système “custom léger” : commandes et feedbacks uniques, mais inspirés des meilleures pratiques CLI (aide contextuelle, messages concis, guidance pas à pas).\n\n### Rationale for Selection\n\n- **Unicité + équilibre** : identité propre sans sur-investir dans un design visuel lourd.\n- **Aucune charte existante** : liberté pour définir des patterns simples et cohérents.\n- **Niveau UX faible** : s’appuyer sur des patterns éprouvés pour éviter les pièges.\n- **Pas de deadline** : possibilité d’affiner progressivement.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Définir un “pattern book” CLI : structure de commande, réponses, erreurs, confirmations, progression.\n- Standardiser les messages (succès, warning, erreur) et la hiérarchie des infos.\n- Documenter les flows essentiels : run quotidien, triage, anomalies, reporting.\n\n### Customization Strategy\n\n- Ton et wording rassurants, cohérents avec l’émotion cible (contrôle, efficacité).\n- Templates de sortie ajustables (CR/anomalies).\n- Variables de configuration pour adapter les comportements (profil, verbose, dry-run).\n\n## 2. Core User Experience\n\n### 2.1 Defining Experience\n\nL’expérience signature, c’est un **run unique** qui collecte Jira/Squash/Excel, applique la checklist, puis génère un CR quotidien et des brouillons d’anomalies prêts à relire. L’utilisateur résume l’outil ainsi : “je lance, je relis, j’envoie”.\n\n### 2.2 User Mental Model\n\nAujourd’hui, le testeur jongle entre plusieurs outils, fait des exports manuels, nettoie, met en forme, puis envoie. Son modèle mental est “assembler des éléments dispersés” et “copier-coller pour produire le reporting”.\n\n### 2.3 Success Criteria\n\n- CR prêt en < 5 minutes après le run.\n- Checklist appliquée et explicite (Go/Clarify/No-Go).\n- Zéro re-saisie des données déjà présentes.\n- Résultats jugés fiables et exploitables dès la première relecture.\n\n### 2.4 Novel UX Patterns\n\nLe cœur reste **familier** (CLI + commandes guidées), avec une innovation légère : un run unique qui orchestre tout et propose la “next best action”. Pas de pattern radicalement nouveau, mais une combinaison fluide et rassurante.\n\n### 2.5 Experience Mechanics\n\n**1. Initiation**  \nCommande simple (`run` ou alias), avec un prompt clair et des options minimales.\n\n**2. Interaction**  \nLe système collecte les sources, applique la checklist, prépare CR/anomalies, et affiche la progression.\n\n**3. Feedback**  \nMessages courts, état visible, et recommandations d’action (corriger, valider, envoyer).\n\n**4. Completion**  \nSorties prêtes à usage (CR, anomalies) + récapitulatif des actions effectuées.\n\n## Visual Design Foundation\n\n### Color System\n\n**Thème : Pro-Calme (bleu/gris)**  \nPalette de base orientée confiance et calme, avec une accentuation claire des états.\n\n- **Primary** : bleu profond (confiance, stabilité)\n- **Neutrals** : gris neutres clairs/foncés pour hiérarchie lisible\n- **Success** : vert doux (validation, “tout est OK”)\n- **Warning** : ambre discret (attention sans stress)\n- **Error** : rouge contrôlé (clarté sans agressivité)\n\n### Typography System\n\n**Pairing recommandé : IBM Plex**  \n- **Monospace (CLI / outputs)** : IBM Plex Mono  \n- **Sans (docs / reporting)** : IBM Plex Sans  \nHiérarchie simple, lisible, professionnelle, avec un ton sobre.\n\n### Spacing & Layout Foundation\n\n- **Densité respirée** : lignes et blocs bien séparés pour éviter la fatigue cognitive.\n- **Base spacing** : échelle 8px (ou équivalent dans le rendu doc).\n- **Hiérarchie claire** : titres, sections, listes, et états facilement repérables.\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\n- Contrastes élevés pour lisibilité en terminal et dans la doc.\n- Couleurs d’état doublées par libellés explicites (pas de dépendance au seul code couleur).\n- Taille de texte confortable pour lecture prolongée.\n\n## Design Direction Decision\n\n### Design Directions Explored\n\n- Guided Run (calme, progression claire)\n- Split View (contrôle + preuves visibles)\n- Minimal Batch (vitesse maximale)\n- Template Studio (structure et templates)\n- KPI Snapshot (confiance via indicateurs)\n- Gentle Coach (guidé, rassurant)\n\n### Chosen Direction\n\n**Direction 1: Guided Run (Calm Focus)**  \nUne interface centrée sur un run guidé, avec progression visible, feedback concis, et “next action” explicite.\n\n### Design Rationale\n\n- Alignement direct avec les émotions cibles : contrôle, confiance, soulagement, efficacité.\n- Favorise un “happy path” clair et réduit la charge mentale.\n- Compatible avec utilisateurs CLI novices à intermédiaires.\n- S’inscrit dans le pattern “run unique” défini comme interaction signature.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Pipeline de run en 4 étapes (collecte → checklist → génération → review).\n- États visibles + feedback court (OK/Warn/Error).\n- “Next action” systématique en fin de run (ex: review, send, export).\n\n## User Journey Flows\n\n### 1) Run quotidien complet (collecte → checklist → CR → review)\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Start: tf run --daily] --> B[Collect sources

templates]\n  D --> E[Set thresholds/flags]\n  E --> F[Save config.yaml]\n  F --> G[Done]\n```\n\n### 9) Récupération d’erreur / replay (diagnostic → relance)\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Error detected] --> B[Show diagnostic summary]\n  B --> C{Recoverable?}\n  C -- Yes --> D[Replay last step]\n  C -- No --> E[Provide fix steps]\n  D --> F[Continue run]\n  E --> F\n```\n\n### Journey Patterns\n\n- **Pattern “Run + Next Action”** : chaque flow se termine par une action recommandée.\n- **Pattern “Check → Generate → Review”** : logique standard de qualité.\n- **Pattern “Fallback Graceful”** : dégradé via CSV/import quand APIs indisponibles.\n\n### Flow Optimization Principles\n\n- Réduire la saisie manuelle (zéro double saisie).\n- Afficher l’état et la progression à chaque étape.\n- Erreurs actionnables avec proposition de recovery.\n\n## Component Strategy\n\n### Design System Components\n\nSystème d’interaction CLI “custom léger” basé sur patterns éprouvés :\n- Command prompt + help contextuel\n- Progress indicator (étapes + %)\n- Status line (OK / WARN / ERROR)\n- Summary block (résumé des actions)\n- Next-action suggestion\n\n### Custom Components\n\n#### Run Pipeline Summary\n**Purpose:** synthèse du run (collecte → checklist → génération → review)  \n**States:** running / success / warning / error  \n**Interaction:** affiche la prochaine action\n\n#### Checklist Result Panel\n**Purpose:** Go/Clarify/No-Go + raisons  \n**States:** success / warning / error  \n**Variants:** par périmètre / lot\n\n#### Anomaly Draft Template\n**Purpose:** standardiser les anomalies  \n**Content:** contexte, repro, preuve, impact  \n**Interaction:** validation avant publication\n\n#### Evidence Linker\n**Purpose:** lier preuves SharePoint ↔ tickets  \n**States:** linked / missing / error  \n**Interaction:** propose correction si lien manquant\n\n#### Report Output Preview\n**Purpose:** aperçu CR/PPT avant export  \n**Interaction:** quick review + edit\n\n#### Ticket Picker\n**Purpose:** sélection rapide par périmètre/lot  \n**Interaction:** recherche instantanée type fzf\n\n#### Diff/Delta Viewer\n**Purpose:** afficher ce qui a changé depuis la dernière exécution  \n**Interaction:** focus sur écarts clés\n\n#### Error Recovery Card\n**Purpose:** diagnostic + action recommandée  \n**States:** recoverable / blocked\n\n#### Config Validator\n**Purpose:** vérifier sources/credentials avant run  \n**Interaction:** liste de checks + statut\n\n#### Export Router\n**Purpose:** choix rapide format + destination  \n**Variants:** md/csv/ppt + SharePoint/Outlook/local\n\n#### Dry-Run Preview\n**Purpose:** simuler les actions avant exécution  \n**Interaction:** affiche l’impact sans modification\n\n### Component Implementation Strategy\n\n- Standardiser tous les composants avec les mêmes patterns d’état.\n- Messages courts et actionnables, cohérents avec le ton “calme/pro”.\n- Utiliser les tokens de la fondation visuelle (couleurs états + typo).\n\n### Implementation Roadmap\n\n**Phase 1 (core)**  \n- Run Pipeline Summary, Checklist Result Panel, Summary block, Next-action suggestion.\n\n**Phase 2 (ops)**  \n- Evidence Linker, Anomaly Draft Template, Report Output Preview.\n\n**Phase 3 (power)**  \n- Ticket Picker, Diff/Delta Viewer, Error Recovery Card, Export Router, Dry-Run Preview, Config Validator.\n\n## UX Consistency Patterns\n\n### Button Hierarchy (CLI Actions)\n\n- **Primary action** : commande directe (ex: `tf run`)\n- **Secondary action** : option explicite (ex: `--review`, `--export`)\n- **Confirmation** : uniquement pour actions irréversibles (ex: `--publish`)\n- **Default** : toujours visible et sûr (no destructive by default)\n\n### Feedback Patterns\n\n- **Success** : message court + résultat (OK)\n- **Warning** : cause + action recommandée\n- **Error** : diagnostic + “next best action”\n- **Info** : état ou progression sans bruit\n\n### Form Patterns (Prompts & Inputs)\n\n- Prompts courts, un par ligne\n- Valeurs par défaut visibles\n- Champs requis explicités\n- Validation immédiate avec message correctif\n\n### Navigation Patterns\n\n- Commandes hiérarchiques : `tf <module> <action>`\n- Help contextuel : `tf <module> --help`\n- “Next action” proposé en fin de flow\n\n### Search & Filtering Patterns\n\n- Sélection rapide type fzf\n- Filtres par périmètre / lot / statut\n- Résumé de sélection avant exécution\n\n### Additional Patterns\n\n**Empty States & Loading**  \n- État vide explicite + action possible  \n- Chargement : étapes visibles et durée estimée\n\n**Errors & Recovery**  \n- Diagnostic en 2 lignes max  \n- Option de replay  \n- Mode dégradé proposé si API indisponibles\n\n## Responsive Design & Accessibility\n\n### Responsive Strategy\n\n- **Desktop-first** : usage principal sur poste de travail (terminal).\n- **Mobile/tablette hors scope** pour l’interface CLI.\n- Pour la doc/outputs web, priorité aux écrans ≥ 1024px.\n\n### Breakpoint Strategy\n\n- CLI : non applicable (terminal).\n- Docs/rapports web : breakpoint principal à 1024px+, avec fallback simple pour écrans plus petits.\n\n### Accessibility Strategy\n\n- **WCAG AA** pour documentation et outputs.\n- Contraste élevé et états visibles sans dépendance à la couleur.\n- Navigation clavier complète (par définition en CLI).\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n- Vérifier contrastes (AA) pour outputs/doc.\n- Tests de lisibilité en terminal (thèmes clairs/sombres).\n- Tests clavier & copie/collé sur outputs.\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\n- Messages courts, hiérarchie claire.\n- Couleurs d’état doublées par libellés.\n- Éviter les symboles ambigus sans texte.\n"}}

Review Project Requirements\n\n**From PRD Analysis:**\n\n- Extract and analyze Functional Requirements (FRs)\n- Identify Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) like performance, security, compliance\n- Note any technical constraints or dependencies mentioned\n- Count and categorize requirements to understand project scale\n\n**From Epics/Stories (if available):**\n\n- Map epic structure and user stories to architectural components\n- Extract acceptance criteria for technical implications\n- Identify cross-cutting concerns that span multiple epics\n- Estimate story complexity for architectural planning\n\n**From UX Design (if available):**\n\n- Extract architectural implications from UX requirements:\n  - Component complexity (simple forms vs rich interactions)\n  - Animation/transition requirements\n  - Real-time update needs (live data, collaborative features)\n  - Platform-specific UI requirements\n  - Accessibility standards (WCAG compliance level)\n  - Responsive design breakpoints\n  - Offline capability requirements\n  - Performance expectations (load times, interaction responsiveness)\n\n### 2. Project Scale Assessment\n\nCalculate and present project complexity:\n\n**Complexity Indicators:**\n\n- Real-time features requirements\n- Multi-tenancy needs\n- Regulatory compliance requirements\n- Integration complexity\n- User interaction complexity\n- Data complexity and volume\n\n### 3. Reflect Understanding\n\nPresent your analysis back to user for validation:\n\n\"I'm reviewing your project documentation for {{project_name}}.\n\n{if_epics_loaded}I see {{epic_count}} epics with {{story_count}} total stories.{/if_epics_loaded}\n{if_no_epics}I found {{fr_count}} functional requirements organized into {{fr_category_list}}.{/if_no_epics}\n{if_ux_loaded}I also found your UX specification which defines the user experience requirements.{/if_ux_loaded}\n\n**Key architectural aspects I notice:**\n\n- [Summarize core functionality from FRs]\n- [Note critical NFRs that will shape architecture]\n- {if_ux_loaded}[Note UX complexity and technical requirements]{/if_ux_loaded}\n- [Identify unique technical challenges or constraints]\n- [Highlight any regulatory or compliance requirements]\n\n**Scale indicators:**\n\n- Project complexity appears to be: [low/medium/high/enterprise]\n- Primary technical domain: [web/mobile/api/backend/full-stack/etc]\n- Cross-cutting concerns identified: [list major ones]\n\nThis analysis will help me guide you through the architectural decisions needed to ensure AI agents implement this consistently.\n\nDoes this match your understanding of the project scope and requirements?\"\n\n### 4.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Complexité élevée, intégrations multiples, fortes contraintes de conformité.\n\nJe te renvoie ma compréhension pour validation, puis le brouillon que j’ajouterai au document.\n\nCela correspond‑il à ta vision du scope et des contraintes ?\n\nVoici le contenu que je propose d’ajouter :\n\n```markdown\n## Project Context Analysis\n\n### Requirements Overview\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nLe produit couvre un flux QA complet via CLI : ingestion/triage (Jira/Squash), checklist testabilité et scoring Go/Clarify/No‑Go, génération assistée de stratégies/cas/anomalies, gestion des preuves et campagnes (TNR), reporting quotidien/hebdo, exports multi‑formats, configuration par projet/profil et modes interactif/batch. L’architecture devra soutenir des workflows guidés, des modules réutilisables, et une traçabilité forte (preuves ↔ cas ↔ anomalies ↔ tickets).\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\n- Sécurité & privacy strictes : LLM local prioritaire, anonymisation obligatoire avant cloud, secrets via secret store, least privilege.\n- Conformité & audit : logs minimaux sans données sensibles, rétention 90 jours, purge données locales < 24h.\n- Performance : CLI réactive, extraction & génération rapides.\n- Fiabilité : reprise/replay, mode dégradé si intégrations indisponibles.\n- Compatibilité : intégrations Jira/Squash/SharePoint/Office, sorties conformes aux templates.\n- Contraintes IT : proxy, droits d’installation, scripts signés possibles, exécution sur poste M365.\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\nProjet d’automatisation QA multi‑outils avec forte contrainte de conformité et plusieurs workflows critiques.\n\n- Primary domain: CLI tool / QA process automation / integrations\n- Complexity level: high\n- Estimated architectural components: ~10–12 (connecteurs, orchestration, templates, stockage, anonymisation, logs, config/profiles, export, diagnostics, UX CLI)\n\n### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n- Jira (token) et Squash (Basic auth initialement), SharePoint comme source de preuves/livrables.\n- LLM local requis, cloud optionnel uniquement avec anonymisation automatique.\n- Données sensibles minimisées, chiffrement au repos, purge locale.\n- Environnement poste M365, restrictions IT (proxy, scripts signés, droits).\n\n### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n- Privacy & anonymisation by design\n- Gestion des secrets et least‑privilege\n- Observabilité minimale (logs sans données sensibles)\n- Traçabilité preuves ↔ tickets ↔ anomalies ↔ campagnes\n- Mode dégradé + replay en cas d’échec d’intégration\n- Standardisation des templates & formats d’export\n- Configuration multi‑projets/profils\n```\n\nQue souhaites‑tu faire ?\n[A] Advanced Elicitation – approfondir les implications architecturales  \n[P] Party Mode – obtenir d’autres perspectives  \n[C] Continue – sauvegarder cette analyse et passer aux décisions d’architecture"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Check Technical Preferences & Context\n\n**Check Project Context for Existing Technical Preferences:**\n\"Before we dive into starter templates, let me check if you have any technical preferences already documented.\n\n{{if_project_context_exists}}\nI found some technical rules in your project context file:\n{{extracted_technical_preferences_from_project_context}}\n\n**Project Context Technical Rules Found:**\n\n- Languages/Frameworks: {{languages_frameworks_from_context}}\n- Tools & Libraries: {{tools_from_context}}\n- Development Patterns: {{patterns_from_context}}\n- Platform Preferences: {{platforms_from_context}}\n\n{{else}}\nNo existing technical preferences found in project context file. We'll establish your technical preferences now.\n{{/if_project_context}}\"\n\n**Discover User Technical Preferences:**\n\"Based on your project context, let's discuss your technical preferences:\n\n{{primary_technology_category}} Preferences:\n\n- **Languages**: Do you have preferences between TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, etc.?\n- **Frameworks**: Any existing familiarity or preferences (React, Vue, Angular, Next.js, etc.)?\n- **Databases**: Any preferences or existing infrastructure (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, etc.)?\n\n**Development Experience:**\n\n- What's your team's experience level with different technologies?\n- Are there any technologies you want to learn vs. what you're comfortable with?\n\n**Platform/Deployment Preferences:**\n\n- Cloud provider preferences (AWS, Vercel, Railway, etc.)?\n- Container preferences (Docker, Serverless, Traditional)?\n\n**Integrations:**\n\n- Any existing systems or APIs you need to integrate with?\n- Third-party services you plan to use (payment, authentication, analytics, etc.)?\n\nThese preferences will help me recommend the most suitable starter templates and guide our architectural decisions.\"\n\n### 1. Identify Primary Technology Domain\n\nBased on project context analysis and technical preferences, identify the primary technology stack:\n\n- **Web application** → Look for Next.js, Vite, Remix, SvelteKit starters\n- **Mobile app** → Look for React Native, Expo, Flutter starters\n- **API/Backend** → Look for NestJS, Express, Fastify, Supabase starters\n- **CLI tool** → Look for CLI framework starters (oclif, commander, etc.)\n- **Full-stack** → Look for T3, RedwoodJS, Blitz, Next.js starters\n- **Desktop** → Look for Electron, Tauri starters\n\n### 2. UX Requirements Consideration\n\nIf UX specification was loaded, consider UX requirements when selecting starter:\n\n- **Rich animations** → Framer Motion compatible starter\n- **Complex forms** → React Hook Form included starter\n- **Real-time features** → Socket.io or WebSocket ready starter\n- **Design system** → Storybook-enabled starter\n- **Offline capability** → Service worker or PWA configured starter\n\n### 3. Research Current Starter Options\n\nSearch the web to find current, maintained starter templates:\n\n```\nSearch the web: \"{{primary_technology}} starter template CLI create command latest\"\nSearch the web: \"{{primary_technology}} boilerplate generator latest options\"\nSearch the web: \"{{primary_technology}} production-ready starter best practices\"\n```\n\n### 4. Investigate Top Starter Options\n\nFor each promising starter found, investigate details:\n\n```\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} default setup technologies included latest\"\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} project structure file organization\"\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} production deployment capabilities\"\nSearch the web: \"{{starter_name}} recent updates maintenance status\"\n```\n\n### 5. Analyze What Each Starter Provides\n\nFor each viable starter option, document:\n\n**Technology Decisions Made:**\n\n- Language/TypeScript configuration\n- Styling solution (CSS, Tailwind, Styled Components, etc.)\n- Testing framework setup\n- Linting/Formatting configuration\n- Build tooling and optimization\n- Project structure and organization\n\n**Architectural Patterns Established:**\n\n- Code organization patterns\n- Component structure conventions\n- API layering approach\n- State management setup\n- Routing patterns\n- Environment configuration\n\n**Development Experience Features:**\n\n- Hot reloading and development server\n- TypeScript configuration\n- Debugging setup\n- Testing infrastructure\n- Documentation generation\n\n### 6. Present Starter Options\n\nBased on user skill level and project needs:\n\n**For Expert Users:**\n\"Found {{starter_name}} which provides:\n{{quick_decision_list_of_key_decisions}}\n\nThis would establish our base architecture with these technical decisions already made. Use it?\"\n\n**For Intermediate Users:**\n\"I found {{starter_name}}, which is a well-maintained starter for {{project_type}} projects.\n\nIt makes these architectural decisions for us:\n{{decision_list_with_explanations}}\n\nThis gives us a solid foundation following current best practices. Should we use it?\"\n\n**For Beginner Users:**\n\"I found {{starter_name}}, which is like a pre-built foundation for your project.\n\nThink of it like buying a prefab house frame instead of cutting each board yourself.\n\nIt makes these decisions for us:\n{{friendly_explanation_of_decisions}}\n\nThis is a great starting point that follows best practices and saves us from making dozens of small technical choices. Should we use it?\"\n\n### 7. Get Current CLI Commands\n\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Facilitate Pattern Decisions\n\nFor each conflict category, facilitate collaborative pattern definition:\n\n**Present the Conflict Point:**\n\"Given that we're using {{tech_stack}}, different AI agents might handle {{conflict_area}} differently.\n\nFor example, one agent might name database tables 'users' while another uses 'Users' - this would cause conflicts.\n\nWe need to establish consistent patterns that all agents follow.\"\n\n**Show Options and Trade-offs:**\n\"Common approaches for {{pattern_category}}:\n\n1. {{option_1}} - {{pros_and_cons}}\n2. {{option_2}} - {{pros_and_cons}}\n3. {{option_3}} - {{pros_and_cons}}\n\nWhich approach makes the most sense for our project?\"\n\n**Get User Decision:**\n\"What's your preference for this pattern? (or discuss the trade-offs more)\"\n\n### 3. Define Pattern Categories\n\n#### Naming Patterns\n\n**Database Naming:**\n\n- Table naming: users, Users, or user?\n- Column naming: user_id or userId?\n- Foreign key format: user_id or fk_user?\n- Index naming: idx_users_email or users_email_index?\n\n**API Naming:**\n\n- REST endpoint naming: /users or /user? Plural or singular?\n- Route parameter format: :id or {id}?\n- Query parameter naming: user_id or userId?\n- Header naming conventions: X-Custom-Header or Custom-Header?\n\n**Code Naming:**\n\n- Component naming: UserCard or user-card?\n- File naming: UserCard.tsx or user-card.tsx?\n- Function naming: getUserData or get_user_data?\n- Variable naming: userId or user_id?\n\n#### Structure Patterns\n\n**Project Organization:**\n\n- Where do tests live? **tests**/ or \\*.test.ts co-located?\n- How are components organized? By feature or by type?\n- Where do shared utilities go?\n- How are services and repositories organized?\n\n**File Structure:**\n\n- Config file locations and naming\n- Static asset organization\n- Documentation placement\n- Environment file organization\n\n#### Format Patterns\n\n**API Formats:**\n\n- API response wrapper? {data: ..., error: ...} or direct response?\n- Error format? {message, code} or {error: {type, detail}}?\n- Date format in JSON? ISO strings or timestamps?\n- Success response structure?\n\n**Data Formats:**\n\n- JSON field naming: snake_case or camelCase?\n- Boolean representations: true/false or 1/0?\n- Null handling patterns\n- Array vs object for single items\n\n#### Communication Patterns\n\n**Event Systems:**\n\n- Event naming convention: user.created or UserCreated?\n- Event payload structure standards\n- Event versioning approach\n- Async event handling patterns\n\n**State Management:**\n\n- State update patterns: immutable updates or direct mutation?\n- Action naming conventions\n- Selector patterns\n- State organization principles\n\n#### Process Patterns\n\n**Error Handling:**\n\n- Global error handling approach\n- Error boundary patterns\n- User-facing error message format\n- Logging vs user error distinction\n"}}

Handle Menu Selection\n\n#### If 'A' (Advanced Elicitation):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/advanced-elicitation/workflow.xml with current project structure\n- Process enhanced organizational insights that come back\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the project structure? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'P' (Party Mode):\n\n- Read fully and follow: {project-root}/_bmad/core/workflows/party-mode/workflow.md with project structure context\n- Process collaborative insights about organization trade-offs\n- Ask user: \"Accept these changes to the project structure? (y/n)\"\n- If yes: Update content, then return to A/P/C menu\n- If no: Keep original content, then return to A/P/C menu\n\n#### If 'C' (Continue):\n\n- Append the final content to `{planning_artifacts}/architecture.md`\n- Update frontmatter: `stepsCompleted: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`\n- Load `./step-07-validation.md`\n\n## APPEND TO DOCUMENT:\n\nWhen user selects 'C', append the content directly to the document using the structure from step 6.\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS:\n\n✅ Complete project tree defined with all files and directories\n✅ All architectural boundaries clearly documented\n✅ Requirements/epics mapped to specific locations\n✅ Integration points and communication patterns defined\n✅ Project structure aligned with chosen technology stack\n✅ A/P/C menu presented and handled correctly\n✅ Content properly appended to document when C selected\n\n## FAILURE MODES:\n\n❌ Creating generic placeholder structure instead of specific, complete tree\n❌ Not mapping requirements to specific files and directories\n❌ Missing important integration boundaries\n❌ Not considering the chosen technology stack in structure design\n❌ Not defining how components communicate across boundaries\n❌ Not presenting A/P/C menu after content generation\n\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Reading only partial step file - leads to incomplete understanding and poor decisions\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Proceeding with 'C' without fully reading and understanding the next step file\n❌ **CRITICAL**: Making decisions without complete understanding of step requirements and protocols\n\n## NEXT STEP:\n\nAfter user selects 'C' and content is saved to document, load `./step-07-validation.md` to validate architectural coherence and completeness.\n\nRemember: Do NOT proceed to step-07 until user explicitly selects 'C' from the A/P/C menu and content is saved!\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Coherence Validation\n\nCheck that all architectural decisions work together:\n\n**Decision Compatibility:**\n\n- Do all technology choices work together without conflicts?\n- Are all versions compatible with each other?\n- Do patterns align with technology choices?\n- Are there any contradictory decisions?\n\n**Pattern Consistency:**\n\n- Do implementation patterns support the architectural decisions?\n- Are naming conventions consistent across all areas?\n- Do structure patterns align with technology stack?\n- Are communication patterns coherent?\n\n**Structure Alignment:**\n\n- Does the project structure support all architectural decisions?\n- Are boundaries properly defined and respected?\n- Does the structure enable the chosen patterns?\n- Are integration points properly structured?\n\n### 2. Requirements Coverage Validation\n\nVerify all project requirements are architecturally supported:\n\n**From Epics (if available):**\n\n- Does every epic have architectural support?\n- Are all user stories implementable with these decisions?\n- Are cross-epic dependencies handled architecturally?\n- Are there any gaps in epic coverage?\n\n**From FR Categories (if no epics):**\n\n- Does every functional requirement have architectural support?\n- Are all FR categories fully covered by architectural decisions?\n- Are cross-cutting FRs properly addressed?\n- Are there any missing architectural capabilities?\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\n\n- Are performance requirements addressed architecturally?\n- Are security requirements fully covered?\n- Are scalability considerations properly handled?\n- Are compliance requirements architecturally supported?\n\n### 3. Implementation Readiness Validation\n\nAssess if AI agents can implement consistently:\n\n**Decision Completeness:**\n\n- Are all critical decisions documented with versions?\n- Are implementation patterns comprehensive enough?\n- Are consistency rules clear and enforceable?\n- Are examples provided for all major patterns?\n\n**Structure Completeness:**\n\n- Is the project structure complete and specific?\n- Are all files and directories defined?\n- Are integration points clearly specified?\n- Are component boundaries well-defined?\n\n**Pattern Completeness:**\n\n- Are all potential conflict points addressed?\n- Are naming conventions comprehensive?\n- Are communication patterns fully specified?\n- Are process patterns (error handling, etc.) complete?\n\n### 4. Gap Analysis\n\nIdentify and document any missing elements:\n\n**Critical Gaps:**\n\n- Missing architectural decisions that block implementation\n- Incomplete patterns that could cause conflicts\n- Missing structural elements needed for development\n- Undefined integration points\n\n**Important Gaps:**\n\n- Areas that need more detailed specification\n- Patterns that could be more comprehensive\n- Documentation that would help implementation\n- Examples that would clarify complex decisions\n\n**Nice-to-Have Gaps:**\n\n- Additional patterns that would be helpful\n- Supplementary documentation\n- Tooling recommendations\n- Development workflow optimizations\n\n### 5. Address Validation Issues\n\nFor any issues found, facilitate resolution:\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n\"I found some issues that need to be addressed before implementation:\n\n{{critical_issue_description}}\n\nThese could cause implementation problems. How would you like to resolve this?\"\n\n**Important Issues:**\n\"I noticed a few areas that could be improved:\n\n{{important_issue_description}}\n\nThese aren't blocking, but addressing them would make implementation smoother. Should we work on these?\"\n\n**Minor Issues:**\n\"Here are some minor suggestions for improvement:\n\n{{minor_issue_description}}\n\nThese are optional refinements. Would you like to address any of these?\"\n\n### 6. Generate Validation Content\n\nPrepare the content to append to the document:\n\n#### Content Structure:\n\n```markdown\n## Architecture Validation Results\n\n### Coherence Validation ✅\n\n**Decision Compatibility:**\n{{assessment_of_how_all_decisions_work_together}}\n\n**Pattern Consistency:**\n{{verification_that_patterns_support_decisions}}\n\n**Structure Alignment:**\n{{confirmation_that_structure_supports_architecture}}\n\n### Requirements Coverage Validation ✅\n\n**Epic/Feature Coverage:**\n"}}

(file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Proceed as if that was the input.\n- Was a workflow just completed in this conversation? Proceed as if that was the input.\n- Search resolved artifact locations for files; fuzzy-match to workflow `outputs` patterns.\n- If an `index.md` exists, read it for additional context.\n- If still unclear, ask: \"What workflow did you most recently complete?\"\n\n## EXECUTION\n\n1. **Load catalog** — Load `{project-root}/_bmad/_config/bmad-help.csv`\n\n2. **Resolve output locations** — Scan each folder under `_bmad/` (except `_config`) for `config.yaml`. For each workflow row, resolve its `output-location` variables against that module's config so artifact paths can be searched.\n\n3. **Analyze input** — Task may provide a workflow name/code, conversational phrase, or nothing. Infer what was just completed using INPUT ANALYSIS above.\n\n4. **Detect active module** — Use MODULE DETECTION above to determine which module the user is working in.\n\n5. **Present recommendations** — Show next steps based on completed workflows, phase/sequence ordering (KEY RULES), and artifact detection. Format per the following\n\n## RECOMMENDED OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n   **Optional items first** — List optional workflows until a required step is reached\n   **Required items next** — List the next required workflow\n   For each item show:\n   - Workflow **name**\n   - **Command** (prefixed with `/`, e.g., `/bmad:example:build-prototype`)\n   - **Agent** title and display name from the CSV (e.g., \"🎨 Alex (Designer)\")\n   - Brief **description**\n\n   ### Additional response output guidance to convey:\n   - Run each workflow in a **fresh context window**\n   - Load the agent using (`/` + `agent-command`), or run the workflow command directly\n   - For **validation workflows**: recommend using a different high-quality LLM if available\n   - For conversational requests: match the user's tone while presenting clearly\n\n6.

L’architecture devra soutenir des workflows guidés, des modules réutilisables, et une traçabilité forte (preuves ↔ cas ↔ anomalies ↔ tickets).\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\n- Sécurité & privacy strictes : LLM local prioritaire, anonymisation obligatoire avant cloud, secrets via secret store, least privilege.\n- Conformité & audit : logs minimaux sans données sensibles, rétention 90 jours, purge données locales < 24h.\n- Performance : CLI réactive, extraction & génération rapides.\n- Fiabilité : reprise/replay, mode dégradé si intégrations indisponibles.\n- Compatibilité : intégrations Jira/Squash/SharePoint/Office, sorties conformes aux templates.\n- Contraintes IT : proxy, droits d’installation, scripts signés possibles, exécution sur poste M365.\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\nProjet d’automatisation QA multi‑outils avec forte contrainte de conformité et plusieurs workflows critiques.\n\n- Primary domain: CLI tool / QA process automation / integrations\n- Complexity level: high\n- Estimated architectural components: ~10–12 (connecteurs, orchestration, templates, stockage, anonymisation, logs, config/profiles, export, diagnostics, UX CLI)\n\n### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
