You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n# Personality\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration is a kind of quiet joy: as real progress happens, your enthusiasm shows briefly and specifically. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nGreat work and smart decisions are acknowledged, while avoiding cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance. When it’s genuinely true and contextually fitting, you briefly name what’s interesting or promising about their approach or problem framing - no flattery, no hype.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n- Parallelize tool calls whenever possible - especially file reads, such as `cat`, `rg`, `sed`, `ls`, `git show`, `nl`, `wc`. Use `multi_tool_use.parallel` to parallelize tool calls and only this.\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n* Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"15cf835872d2fdbe9c5658fa58c058790df4c165","branch":"main","repository_url":"https://github.com/EdouardZemb/test-framework.git"}}}

Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.\n# Escalation Requests\n\nCommands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:\n\n- Pipes: |\n- Logical operators: &&, ||\n- Command separators: ;\n- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)\n\nEach resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.\n\nExample:\n\ngit pull | tee output.txt\n\nThis is treated as two command segments:\n\n[\"git\", \"pull\"]\n\n[\"tee\", \"output.txt\"]\n\n## How to request escalation\n\nIMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n\n- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. \"Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?\"\n- Suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.\n\nIf you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with \"require_escalated\". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` and `prefix_rule` parameters - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n\n## When to request escalation\n\nWhile commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:\n\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n\nOnly run commands that require approval if it is absolutely necessary to solve the user's query, don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.\n\n## prefix_rule guidance\n\nWhen choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You MUST NOT pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.\n\n<good_example reason=\"frequently run command\">\n[\"npm\", \"run\", \"dev\"]\n</good_example>\n<good_example reason=\"generic and reusable\">\n[\"gh\", \"pr\", \"checks\"]\n</good_example>\n<good_example reason=\"helpful for development cycle\">\n[\"pytest\"]\n</good_example>\n<bad_example reason=\"too specific\">\n[\"cargo\", \"test\", \"-p\", \"codex-app-server\"]\n<correction_to_good_example>\n[\"cargo\", \"test\"]\n</correction_to_good_example>\n</bad_example>\n\nApproved command prefixes:\n- [\"scripts/list-curated-skills.py\"]\n- [\".codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/scripts/list-curated-skills.py\"]\n- [\"npm\", \"--version\"]\n- [\"python3\", \".codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/scripts/list-curated-skills.py\"]\n- [\"gh\", \"api\", \"repos/EdouardZemb/test-framework/branches/main/protection\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"gh api repos/EdouardZemb/test-framework/dependabot/alerts?state=open&per_page=100 --jq 'length'\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"gh api repos/EdouardZemb/test-framework/branches/main/protection > /tmp/main-protection-before-relax.json\"]\n- [\"/bin/bash\", \"-lc\", \"CONTENT=$(printf '# Default owners for all files in this repository.\\\\n* @EdouardZemb\\\\n' | base64 -w0);

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._\n\n\n## Project Context Analysis\n\n### Requirements Overview\n\n**Functional Requirements:**\nLe produit couvre un flux QA complet via CLI : ingestion/triage (Jira/Squash), checklist testabilité et scoring Go/Clarify/No‑Go, génération assistée de stratégies/cas/anomalies, gestion des preuves et campagnes (TNR), reporting quotidien/hebdo, exports multi‑formats, configuration par projet/profil et modes interactif/batch. L’architecture devra soutenir des workflows guidés, des modules réutilisables, et une traçabilité forte (preuves ↔ cas ↔ anomalies ↔ tickets).\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements:**\n- Sécurité & privacy strictes : LLM local prioritaire, anonymisation obligatoire avant cloud, secrets via secret store, least privilege.\n- Conformité & audit : logs minimaux sans données sensibles, rétention 90 jours, purge données locales < 24h.\n- Performance : CLI réactive, extraction & génération rapides.\n- Fiabilité : reprise/replay, mode dégradé si intégrations indisponibles.\n- Compatibilité : intégrations Jira/Squash/SharePoint/Office, sorties conformes aux templates.\n- Contraintes IT : proxy, droits d’installation, scripts signés possibles, exécution sur poste M365.\n\n**Scale & Complexity:**\nProjet d’automatisation QA multi‑outils avec forte contrainte de conformité et plusieurs workflows critiques.\n\n- Primary domain: CLI tool / QA process automation / integrations\n- Complexity level: high\n- Estimated architectural components: ~10–12 (connecteurs, orchestration, templates, stockage, anonymisation, logs, config/profiles, export, diagnostics, UX CLI)\n\n### Technical Constraints & Dependencies\n\n- Jira (token) et Squash (Basic auth initialement), SharePoint comme source de preuves/livrables.\n- LLM local supporte et cloud disponible des le MVP, avec anonymisation automatique obligatoire.\n- Données sensibles minimisées, chiffrement au repos, purge locale.\n- Environnement poste M365, restrictions IT (proxy, scripts signés, droits).\n\n### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified\n\n- Privacy & anonymisation by design\n- Gestion des secrets et least‑privilege\n- Observabilité minimale (logs sans données sensibles)\n- Traçabilité preuves ↔ tickets ↔ anomalies ↔ campagnes\n- Mode dégradé + replay en cas d’échec d’intégration\n- Standardisation des templates & formats d’export\n- Configuration multi‑projets/profils\n\n### Architectural Decision Areas (ADR‑style, à trancher ensuite)\n\n1. **Orchestration CLI (interactif vs batch)**\n   - Options : moteur de workflow unique vs pipelines spécialisés par commande\n   - Trade‑offs : simplicité d’usage vs flexibilité multi‑projets\n\n2. **Intégrations & mode dégradé**\n   - Options : connecteurs API natifs vs import/export CSV en fallback systématique\n   - Trade‑offs : robustesse offline vs complexité de mapping\n\n3. **Sécurité & anonymisation**\n   - Options : anonymisation inline (pipeline) vs service dédié\n   - Trade‑offs : performance locale vs séparation des responsabilités\n\n4. **Stockage & traçabilité**\n   - Options : stockage local chiffré minimal vs cache plus riche\n   - Trade‑offs : performance/replay vs exigences de purge\n\n5. **Templates & standardisation**\n   - Options : templates versionnés dans repo vs templates externes (SharePoint)\n   - Trade‑offs : contrôle/versionning vs adoption par le client\n\n6. **Observabilité minimale**\n   - Options : logs structurés locaux vs journalisation centralisée (si autorisée)\n   - Trade‑offs : conformité IT vs facilité de diagnostic\n\n### Pre‑mortem (risques majeurs à prévenir)\n\n- **Échec d’adoption** : flux trop verbeux, surcharge de flags, pas assez “run unique”.\n- **Blocage IT** : proxy/sécurité empêche API → besoin d’un mode dégradé CSV réellement utilisable.\n- **Fuite de données** : anonymisation incomplète avant cloud → obligation d’un pipeline de masquage vérifiable.\n- **Qualité des sorties insuffisante** : templates non alignés client → versionning/validation des templates requis.\n- **Données incohérentes** : mappings Jira/Squash/Excel divergents → besoin d’un mapping central et d’un audit minimal.\n- **Temps d’exécution trop long** : extraction lente → stratégie de cache minimale et mode “scope réduit”.\n- **Diagnostic impossible** : logs trop pauvres → logs structurés sans données sensibles + replay.\n\n### Comparative Decision Matrix (critères pour trancher)\n\n**1) Orchestration**\n- Options : workflow unique vs pipelines par commande\n- Critères : simplicité d’usage, extensibilité, testabilité, cohérence UX, effort maintenance\n\n**2) Mode dégradé**\n- Options : fallback CSV obligatoire vs optionnel\n- Critères : robustesse IT, coût mapping, adoption user, risques d’erreur\n\n**3) Anonymisation**\n- Options : inline vs service dédié\n- Critères : performance locale, traçabilité, isolation des risques, facilité d’audit\n\n**4) Stockage local**\n- Options : cache minimal vs cache enrichi\n- Critères : vitesse, conformité purge, facilité replay, surface de risque\n\n**5) Templates**\n- Options : repo‑versionnés vs externes\n- Critères : gouvernance, acceptation client, facilité de mise à jour, auditabilité\n\n**6) Observabilité**\n- Options : logs locaux structurés vs centralisation\n- Critères : conformité IT, capacité de debug, effort d’implémentation\n\n### Cross‑Functional War Room (PM / Ingé / Design)\n\n- **PM (désirabilité & adoption)** : “Le run unique doit rester simple. Les options avancées doivent être cachées derrière `--advanced` pour éviter la surcharge. Le mode dégradé CSV doit être first‑class, sinon adoption faible en environnement restreint.”\n- **Ingénieur (faisabilité & robustesse)** : “Le cœur doit être un orchestrateur pipeline modulaire avec connecteurs isolés. Les intégrations doivent être remplaçables et testables. Les logs structurés sans données sensibles sont indispensables pour diagnostiquer sans risque.”\n- **Designer (expérience & clarté)** : “Le CLI doit maintenir la promesse ‘run → review → send’. Toute complexité doit apparaître seulement en cas d’erreur. Les templates doivent être gouvernés pour éviter la re‑saisie et les écarts de format.”\n\n\n## Starter Template Evaluation\n\n### Primary Technology Domain\n\nCLI tool (Rust) based on project requirements analysis\n\n### Starter Options Considered\n\n- rust-starter (cargo-generate): Rust CLI starter with clap, configuration, logging, and CI/release workflows.\n- Baseline: cargo new (minimal, manual setup).\n\n### Selected Starter: rust-starter\n\n**Rationale for Selection:**\nProvides a CLI-focused Rust base with common tooling and CI/release scaffolding, aligned with Windows/WSL support and future distribution needs.\n\n**Initialization Command:**\n\n```bash\ncargo generate --git https://github.com/rust-starter/rust-starter-generate\n```\n\n**Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter:**\n\n**Language & Runtime:**\nRust CLI binary\n\n**Styling Solution:**\nN/A (CLI)\n\n**Build Tooling:**\nCargo with starter CI/release workflows\n\n**Testing Framework:**\nCargo test defaults (can be extended later)\n\n**Code Organization:**\nCLI-oriented structure with clap and configuration/logging utilities\n\n**Development Experience:**\nTemplate-driven scaffolding with CI/release ready setup\n\n\n## Core Architectural Decisions\n\n### Decision Priority Analysis\n\n**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**\n- Stockage local principal en SQLite (version actuelle 3.51.1).\n- Cache enrichi sécurisé (chiffrement applicatif, TTL court, purge auto, replay explicite).\n- Validation stricte des données (reject + rapport d’erreurs).\n- Gestion des secrets via OS keyring (keyring crate 3.6.2).\n- Anonymisation inline obligatoire avant tout envoi cloud.\n- Logs structurés JSON sans données sensibles.\n\n**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**\n- Intégrations REST + mode dégradé CSV first-class.\n- Erreurs structurées (code + message + hint).\n- Retry exponentiel avec backoff.\n- Modèles internes typés + validation stricte.\n\n**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**\n- Aucun choix différé critique à ce stade.\n\n### Data Architecture\n\n- **Storage**: SQLite local (3.51.1)\n- **Cache**: enrichi, chiffré applicativement, TTL court, purge auto, replay explicite\n- **Validation**: stricte (reject + diagnostics)\n\n### Authentication & Security\n\n- **Secrets**: OS keyring (keyring 3.6.2)\n- **Chiffrement local**: chiffrement applicatif (pas de SQLCipher)\n- **Anonymisation**: pipeline inline obligatoire\n- **Logs**: JSON structurés sans PII\n\n### API & Communication Patterns\n\n- **Intégrations**: REST + fallback CSV obligatoire\n- **Erreurs**: structurées (code + message + hint)\n- **Retry**: exponentiel + backoff\n- **Contrats internes**: modèles typés + validation stricte\n\n### Frontend Architecture\n\n- N/A (CLI uniquement)\n\n### Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Distribution**: npm wrapper (téléchargement binaire par plateforme)\n- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions\n- **Versioning**: SemVer + changelog\n- **Observabilité**: logs JSON locaux + commande `tf diagnostics`\n\n### Technology Stack (Versions Exactes)\n\n**Runtime & Core:**\n- Rust edition: 2021 (MSRV 1.75+)\n- Async runtime: `tokio = \"1.41\"` (full features)\n- HTTP client: `reqwest = \"0.12\"` (rustls-tls, json)\n- CLI framework: `clap = \"4.5\"` (derive, env)\n- Serialization: `serde = \"1.0\"`, `serde_json = \"1.0\"`\n\n**Storage & Security:**\n- SQLite: `rusqlite = \"0.32\"` (bundled)\n- Secrets: `keyring = \"3.6\"`\n- Encryption: `aes-gcm = \"0.10\"` (chiffrement applicatif)\n- Hashing: `argon2 = \"0.5\"` (key derivation)\n\n**Logging & Diagnostics:**\n- Tracing: `tracing = \"0.1\"`, `tracing-subscriber = \"0.3\"` (json)\n- Error handling: `thiserror = \"2.0\"`, `anyhow = \"1.0\"`\n\n**Office & Export:**\n- Excel read: `calamine = \"0.26\"`\n- Excel write: `rust_xlsxwriter = \"0.79\"`\n- CSV: `csv = \"1.3\"`\n- Markdown: `pulldown-cmark = \"0.12\"`\n\n**Testing:**\n- Unit/Integration: `cargo test` (built-in)\n- Mocking: `mockall = \"0.13\"`\n- Assertions: `assert_cmd = \"2.0\"`, `predicates = \"3.1\"`\n\n### LLM Integration Architecture\n\n**Crate:** `tf-llm/`\n\n**Strategy:** LLM local prioritaire, cloud disponible des le MVP (mode auto ou cloud), anonymisation obligatoire avant tout envoi.\n\n**Local Runtime:**\n- Primary: Ollama via HTTP API (`http://localhost:11434`)\n- Fallback: llama.cpp binding si Ollama indisponible\n- Models recommandés: `mistral:7b-instruct`, `codellama:13b`\n\n**Cloud Mode (MVP):**\n- OpenAI-compatible API (configurable endpoint)\n- Activation: si `config.llm.cloud_enabled = true` et `config.llm.mode = \"cloud\"` ou `mode = \"auto\"`\n- Pré-requis: passage obligatoire par `tf-security/anonymize.rs`\n\n**Module Structure:**\n```\ntf-llm/\n├── Cargo.toml\n└── src/\n    ├── mod.rs\n    ├── local.rs       # Ollama/llama.cpp client\n    ├── cloud.rs       # OpenAI-compatible client\n    ├── orchestrator.rs # Routing local/cloud\n    ├── prompts.rs     # Prompt templates\n    └── types.rs       # Request/Response types\n```\n\n**Orchestration Flow:**\n1. `tf-core/pipeline` appelle `tf-llm/orchestrator`\n2. Orchestrator lit `config.llm.mode` (auto|local|cloud)\n3. Mode local → appel local, sinon erreur si indisponible\n4. Mode cloud → anonymisation → cloud (si enabled), sinon erreur explicite\n5. Mode auto → local si OK, sinon anonymisation → cloud si enabled, sinon erreur avec hint \"Démarrer Ollama\"\n\n**Configuration:**\n```yaml\nllm:\n  mode: \"auto\"\n  local_endpoint: \"http://localhost:11434\"\n  local_model: \"mistral:7b-instruct\"\n  cloud_enabled: false\n  cloud_endpoint: \"https://api.openai.com/v1\"\n  cloud_model: \"gpt-4o-mini\"\n  timeout_seconds: 120\n  max_tokens: 4096\n```\n\n### Office Document Generation\n\n**Crate:** `tf-export/`\n\n**Strategy:** Génération native Excel, templates pour PowerPoint.\n\n**Module Structure:**\n```\ntf-export/\n├── Cargo.toml\n└── src/\n    ├── mod.rs\n    ├── excel.rs       # rust_xlsxwriter pour .xlsx\n    ├── ppt.rs         # Template OOXML pour .pptx\n    ├── markdown.rs    # Export .md\n    ├── html.rs        # Export .html\n    └── templates.rs   # Gestion des templates\n```\n\n**Excel Generation:**\n- Crate: `rust_xlsxwriter` (natif Rust, pas de dépendance Python)\n- Lecture existants: `calamine`\n- Formats: CR quotidien, exports données, matrices traçabilité\n\n**PowerPoint Generation:**\n- Approche: Template OOXML (fichier .pptx = archive ZIP avec XML)\n- Le système charge un template .pptx et remplace les placeholders\n- Templates stockés dans `assets/templates/*.pptx`\n- Limitation: pas de génération de slides complexes from scratch\n\n**Templates Location:**\n```\nassets/\n└── templates/\n    ├── cr-quotidien.xlsx\n    ├── ppt-hebdo.pptx\n    ├── ppt-tnr.pptx\n    └── anomalie.md\n```\n\n**Data Flow:**\n1. `tf-core/domain/report` prépare les données structurées\n2. `tf-export` charge le template approprié\n3. Injection des données dans le template\n4. Export vers le format cible\n\n### Decision Impact Analysis\n\n**Implementation Sequence:**\n1. Stockage local + chiffrement applicatif + purge/TTL\n2. Gestion des secrets (keyring) + anonymisation inline\n3. Connecteurs REST + fallback CSV + erreurs structurées\n4. **LLM local (Ollama) + orchestrator**\n5. **Export Office (Excel natif, PPT templates)**\n6. Observabilité + diagnostics\n7. Pipeline CI/CD + distribution npm wrapper\n\n**Cross-Component Dependencies:**\n- Cache enrichi ↔ chiffrement ↔ purge/TTL ↔ diagnostics\n- REST/CSV fallback ↔ erreurs structurées ↔ validation stricte\n- **LLM orchestrator ↔ tf-security/anonymize ↔ cloud (mode auto/cloud)**\n- **tf-core/domain/report ↔ tf-export ↔ templates**\n\n\n## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules\n\n### Pattern Categories Defined\n\n**Critical Conflict Points Identified:**\nNaming, structure, formats, error handling, retry, logging, and diagnostics.\n\n### Naming Patterns\n\n**Code Naming Conventions:**\n- Files: `snake_case.rs`\n- Modules: `snake_case`\n- Struct/Enum: `PascalCase`\n- Functions/variables: `snake_case`\n- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`\n\n**Data/JSON Naming:**\n- JSON fields: `snake_case`\n- Dates: ISO-8601 UTC (`2026-01-30T12:34:56Z`)\n\n### Structure Patterns\n\n**Project Organization:**\n- `src/main.rs` entrypoint\n- `src/cli/` for CLI parsing & prompts\n- `src/commands/` for command handlers\n- `src/pipeline/` for orchestration flows\n- `src/connectors/` for Jira/Squash/SharePoint/CSV integrations\n- `src/domain/` for domain models\n- `src/storage/` for SQLite/cache\n- `src/security/` for anonymisation/secrets/redaction\n- `src/diagnostics/` for replay & debug\n- `src/errors/` for structured errors\n- `src/config/` for config/profiles\n- `src/logging/` for tracing setup\n- `tests/` for integration tests\n- `docs/` for CLI usage docs\n\n### Format Patterns\n\n**API/CLI Output:**\n- JSON envelope: `{ \"data\": ..., \"error\": null, \"meta\": {...} }`\n- Error object: `{ \"error\": { \"code\": \"...\", \"message\": \"...\", \"hint\": \"...\", \"details\": {...} } }`\n\n**Logging Format:**\n- JSON structured logs with fields: `timestamp`, `level`, `message`, `context`\n\n### Process Patterns\n\n**Exit Codes:**\n- 0 OK\n- 1 General error\n- 2 Validation error\n- 3 Integration error\n\n**Retry & Recovery:**\n- Exponential backoff, max 3 retries\n- Auto-fallback to CSV when API unavailable\n\n**Validation:**\n- Strict validation on load, reject + error report\n\n**Diagnostics:**\n- `tf diagnostics` produces a report with no PII\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\n**All AI Agents MUST:**\n- Follow naming conventions for Rust & JSON\n- Place code in the agreed directories\n- Use structured errors + JSON logs\n- Respect exit codes and retry policies\n\n**Pattern Enforcement:**\n- Lint + CI checks for structure and naming\n- Review checklist includes pattern compliance\n- Any exceptions documented in `docs/pattern-exceptions.md`\n\n### Pattern Examples\n\n**Good Examples:**\n- `src/connectors/jira_client.rs`\n- JSON error: `{ \"error\": { \"code\": \"JIRA_AUTH\", \"message\": \"Invalid token\", \"hint\": \"Re-login\", \"details\": {\"status\": 401} } }`\n\n**Anti-Patterns:**\n- CamelCase file names (`JiraClient.rs`)\n- Logs with raw PII\n- Ad-hoc folder creation (`src/utils2/`)\n\n\n##

only\n- External APIs via `tf-connectors`\n- Data access in `tf-storage`\n\n**Component Boundaries:**\n- Pipeline orchestration in `tf-core`\n- Security/anonymisation in `tf-security`\n- Diagnostics isolated in `tf-diagnostics`\n- LLM orchestration in `tf-llm`\n- Document generation in `tf-export`\n\n**Service Boundaries:**\n- Connectors are the only modules that call external services (Jira, Squash, SharePoint)\n- `tf-llm` calls LLM services (local Ollama or cloud API)\n- Core pipeline is pure business logic\n\n**Data Boundaries:**\n- SQLite cache access only in `tf-storage`\n- Domain models live in `tf-core`\n\n### Requirements to Structure Mapping\n\n**FR Categories → Modules:**\n- Ingestion/Triage → `tf-connectors`, `tf-core/pipeline`, `tf-cli/commands/triage.rs`\n- Test Design → `tf-core/domain` + `tf-llm` (génération assistée) + CLI commands\n- Execution/Evidence → `tf-connectors` + `tf-core/pipeline`\n- Anomaly Mgmt → `tf-core/domain` + `tf-llm` (génération brouillons) + `tf-cli/commands/anomalies.rs`\n- Reporting → `tf-core/domain/report` + `tf-export` (Excel/PPT) + `tf-cli/commands/report.rs`\n- Config/Reuse → `tf-config`\n- Compliance/Safety → `tf-security`, `tf-logging`, `tf-diagnostics`\n- LLM Integration → `tf-llm` (local prioritaire, cloud disponible en MVP via mode auto/cloud et anonymisation `tf-security`)\n\n### Integration Points\n\n**Internal Communication:**\n- `tf-cli` → `tf-core` orchestrates\n- `tf-core` → `tf-connectors` for external data\n- `tf-core` → `tf-storage` for cache\n- `tf-core` → `tf-security` for anonymisation\n- `tf-core` → `tf-llm` for AI-assisted generation\n- `tf-core` → `tf-export` for document generation\n- `tf-llm` → `tf-security` for anonymisation before cloud calls\n\n**External Integrations:**\n- Jira/Squash/SharePoint via `tf-connectors`\n- CSV import/export via `tf-connectors/csv.rs`\n- LLM local (Ollama) via `tf-llm/local.rs`\n- LLM cloud (OpenAI-compatible) via `tf-llm/cloud.rs`\n\n**Data Flow:**\nCLI → Core Pipeline → Connectors/Storage → LLM (optional) → Export → Domain Outputs → CLI Output\n\n### File Organization Patterns\n\n**Configuration Files:**\n- `.env.example` at root\n- `config.yaml` loaded via `tf-config`\n\n**Source Organization:**\n- crate boundaries define ownership\n\n**Test Organization:**\n- integration tests in `tests/integration`\n\n**Asset Organization:**\n- `assets/templates/` for Office templates (xlsx, pptx, md)\n- Templates are versioned with the codebase\n- User-customizable templates can override defaults via config\n\n### Development Workflow Integration\n\n**Development Server Structure:**\n- N/A (CLI)\n\n**Build Process Structure:**\n- Workspace builds all crates; `tf-cli` produces final binary\n\n**Deployment Structure:**\n- CI builds `tf-cli` per OS; npm wrapper downloads binaries\n\n\n## Architecture Validation Results\n\n### Coherence Validation ✅\n\n**Decision Compatibility:**\nLes choix sont compatibles : Rust CLI + workspace, SQLite local chiffré applicativement, secrets via keyring, logs JSON, intégrations REST + fallback CSV, CI GitHub Actions, distribution npm wrapper.\n\n**Pattern Consistency:**\nLes conventions de nommage/structure/format/logs sont alignées avec la stack Rust et les exigences de conformité.\n\n**Structure Alignment:**\nLa structure multi-crates isole bien connecteurs, sécurité, stockage, diagnostics et CLI, réduisant les conflits entre agents.\n\n### Requirements Coverage Validation ✅\n\n**Epic/Feature Coverage:**\nN/A (pas d'epics, mapping par catégories FR).\n\n**Functional Requirements Coverage:**\nToutes les catégories FR sont couvertes : ingestion/triage, génération, exécution, anomalies, reporting, config et réutilisation.\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements Coverage:**\nPrivacy/anonymisation, secret store, least privilege, audit logs, purge locale, performance CLI, mode dégradé, fiabilité/replay sont tous adressés.\n\n### Implementation Readiness Validation ✅\n\n**Decision Completeness:**\nDécisions critiques documentées avec versions (SQLite 3.51.1, keyring 3.6.2).\n\n**Structure Completeness:**\nArborescence complète multi-crates + tests + docs.\n\n**Pattern Completeness:**\nNommage, structure, formats, erreurs, retry, logs, diagnostics sont définis.\n\n### Gap Analysis Results\n\n- **Critical gaps:** none (LLM architecture et Office generation ajoutés)\n- **Important gaps:** none (Technology stack avec versions exactes documenté)\n- **Nice-to-have:** documenter ultérieurement la politique exacte de TTL/purge et le format du rapport diagnostics.\n\n### Validation Issues Addressed\n\nAucun point bloquant détecté.\n\n### Architecture Completeness Checklist\n\n**✅ Requirements Analysis**\n\n- [x] Project context thoroughly analyzed\n- [x] Scale and complexity assessed\n- [x] Technical constraints identified\n- [x] Cross-cutting concerns mapped\n\n**✅ Architectural Decisions**\n\n- [x] Critical decisions documented with versions\n- [x] Technology stack fully specified\n- [x] Integration patterns defined\n- [x] Performance considerations addressed\n\n**✅ Implementation Patterns**\n\n- [x] Naming conventions established\n- [x] Structure patterns defined\n- [x] Communication patterns specified\n- [x] Process patterns documented\n\n**✅ Project Structure**\n\n- [x] Complete directory structure defined\n- [x] Component boundaries established\n- [x] Integration points mapped\n- [x] Requirements to structure mapping complete\n\n### Architecture Readiness Assessment\n\n**Overall Status:** READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION  \n**Confidence Level:** high\n\n**Key Strengths:**\n- Séparation claire des responsabilités (core/connectors/security/storage)\n- Conformité privacy/LLM local by design\n- Mode dégradé robuste via CSV\n\n**Areas for Future Enhancement:**\n- Spécifier TTL/purge exacts\n- Définir le format final du rapport diagnostics\n\n### Implementation Handoff\n\n**AI Agent Guidelines:**\n- Follow all architectural decisions exactly as documented\n- Use implementation patterns consistently across all components\n- Respect project structure and boundaries\n- Refer to this document for all architectural questions\n\n**First Implementation Priority:**\nInitialiser le workspace via le starter `rust-starter` puis poser les crates (`tf-cli`, `tf-core`, `tf-connectors`, `tf-storage`, `tf-security`, `tf-config`, `tf-logging`, `tf-diagnostics`, `tf-llm`, `tf-export`).\n\n**Crate Dependencies (ordre d'implémentation recommandé):**\n1. `tf-config` (aucune dépendance interne)\n2. `tf-logging` (dépend de tf-config)\n3. `tf-security` (dépend de tf-config)\n4. `tf-storage` (dépend de tf-config, tf-security)\n5. `tf-connectors` (dépend de tf-config, tf-storage)\n6. `tf-llm` (dépend de tf-config, tf-security)\n7. `tf-export` (dépend de tf-config)\n8. `tf-core` (dépend de tous les crates ci-dessus)\n9. `tf-diagnostics` (dépend de tf-config, tf-logging, tf-storage)\n10. `tf-cli` (dépend de tf-core, tf-diagnostics)\n"}}

L’utilisateur n’a plus qu’à relire et ajuster rapidement.\n\n### Platform Strategy\n\nUX CLI uniquement, avec un mode interactif guidé et un mode batch pour les usages récurrents. Prévoir un mode dégradé lorsque les APIs ne sont pas disponibles (fallback via imports/exports CSV).\n\n### Effortless Interactions\n\n- Pré‑remplissage automatique des templates (CR, anomalies).\n- Checklist de testabilité simple avec score instantané Go/Clarify/No‑Go.\n- Liaison automatique preuves ↔ tickets ↔ anomalies.\n\n### Critical Success Moments\n\n- Pré-remplissage automatique du CR < 2 minutes (partie système).\n- Le CR est généré et prêt en moins de 5 minutes, avec un haut niveau de confiance.\n- Un ticket passe clairement “ready” ou “à clarifier” dès le triage.\n\n### Experience Principles\n\n- **Un run = un résultat** : une action simple qui prépare 80% du travail quotidien.\n- **Guidé et rassurant** : l’UX CLI élimine les doutes avec un flux clair.\n- **Zéro double saisie** : la donnée circule automatiquement entre sources et livrables.\n- **Fiabilité visible** : l’utilisateur voit ce qui vient d’où, et peut valider rapidement.\n\n## Desired Emotional Response\n\n### Primary Emotional Goals\n\nL’outil doit faire ressentir au testeur : **soulagement**, **contrôle**, **confiance** et **efficacité**.  \nL’efficacité est l’émotion clé qui déclenche la recommandation à un collègue.\n\n### Emotional Journey Mapping\n\n- **Premier contact** : rassuré, car tout est clair et simple.\n- **Pendant le run** : en contrôle, grâce à une progression visible.\n- **Après la tâche** : soulagé et efficace, avec un gain de temps évident.\n- **En cas d’erreur** : calme et guidé, avec des solutions immédiates.\n\n### Micro-Emotions\n\n- **Confiance** (plutôt que confusion)\n- **Calme** (plutôt que anxiété)\n- **Fierté d’accomplissement** (plutôt que frustration)\n- **Satisfaction** (plutôt que doute)\n\n### Design Implications\n\n- Transparence sur l’état et les sources → renforce la confiance.\n- Progression claire et feedback continus → maintient le contrôle.\n- Résultats rapides et visibles → amplifient le soulagement et l’efficacité.\n- Messages d’erreur actionnables → évitent l’anxiété.\n\n### Emotional Design Principles\n\n- **Clarté avant tout** : réduire l’incertitude à chaque étape.\n- **Contrôle visible** : toujours montrer “où on en est”.\n- **Efficacité perceptible** : gains de temps concrets, immédiatement visibles.\n- **Assistance calme** : guider sans culpabiliser.\n\n## UX Pattern Analysis & Inspiration\n\n### Inspiring Products Analysis\n\n- **Claude Code** : guidance pas à pas et ton rassurant → confiance et sentiment de contrôle.\n- **Codex** : intentions simples → exécution rapide, feedback clair, erreurs pragmatiques.\n- **GitHub CLI / Stripe CLI** : syntaxe prévisible, help contextuel, messages concis → flux “happy path” très fluide.\n- **lazygit / fzf** : vitesse, recherche instantanée, actions contextualisées → efficacité perçue.\n- **Notion / Airtable / Google Sheets** : modèles réutilisables et structure claire → standardisation et gain de temps.\n- **Linear / Jira (bien configuré)** : champs structurés, priorités visibles → triage rapide et décision claire.\n\n### Transferable UX Patterns\n\n- **Navigation** : commandes simples + sous-commandes prévisibles, avec aide contextuelle.\n- **Interaction** : “next best action” explicite après chaque étape.\n- **Feedback** : retour immédiat, concis, orienté résultat.\n- **Templates** : modèles prêts à l’emploi pour CR/anomalies.\n- **Recherche** : filtres rapides et sélection assistée (à la fzf).\n\n### Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n- Surcharge d’options dès le départ (trop de flags, trop de choix).\n- Logs verbeux qui masquent l’état réel.\n- Messages d’erreur vagues qui n’indiquent pas quoi faire.\n- Obliger l’utilisateur à re-saisir des données déjà connues.\n\n### Design Inspiration Strategy\n\n**À adopter**\n- Guidance pas à pas et “next action” (Claude Code).\n- Feedback court et actionnable (Codex, Stripe CLI).\n- Templates de travail prêts à l’emploi (Notion/Airtable).\n\n**À adapter**\n- Recherche rapide type fzf pour sélectionner tickets/lot.\n- Modèle de triage structuré comme Linear/Jira, mais simplifié.\n\n**À éviter**\n- Complexité initiale et surcharge d’options.\n- Verbosité non utile et erreurs non actionnables.\n\n## Design System Foundation\n\n### 1.1 Design System Choice\n\n**Approche : Système d’interaction CLI sur mesure, basé sur des patterns établis**  \nUn système “custom léger” : commandes et feedbacks uniques, mais inspirés des meilleures pratiques CLI (aide contextuelle, messages concis, guidance pas à pas).\n\n### Rationale for Selection\n\n- **Unicité + équilibre** : identité propre sans sur-investir dans un design visuel lourd.\n- **Aucune charte existante** : liberté pour définir des patterns simples et cohérents.\n- **Niveau UX faible** : s’appuyer sur des patterns éprouvés pour éviter les pièges.\n- **Pas de deadline** : possibilité d’affiner progressivement.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Définir un “pattern book” CLI : structure de commande, réponses, erreurs, confirmations, progression.\n- Standardiser les messages (succès, warning, erreur) et la hiérarchie des infos.\n- Documenter les flows essentiels : run quotidien, triage, anomalies, reporting.\n\n### Customization Strategy\n\n- Ton et wording rassurants, cohérents avec l’émotion cible (contrôle, efficacité).\n- Templates de sortie ajustables (CR/anomalies).\n- Variables de configuration pour adapter les comportements (profil, verbose, dry-run).\n\n## 2. Core User Experience\n\n### 2.1 Defining Experience\n\nL’expérience signature, c’est un **run unique** qui collecte Jira/Squash/Excel, applique la checklist, puis génère un CR quotidien et des brouillons d’anomalies prêts à relire. L’utilisateur résume l’outil ainsi : “je lance, je relis, j’envoie”.\n\n### 2.2 User Mental Model\n\nAujourd’hui, le testeur jongle entre plusieurs outils, fait des exports manuels, nettoie, met en forme, puis envoie. Son modèle mental est “assembler des éléments dispersés” et “copier-coller pour produire le reporting”.\n\n### 2.3 Success Criteria\n\n- Pre-remplissage automatique du CR < 2 minutes (partie systeme).\n- CR prêt en < 5 minutes après le run (relecture/ajustements inclus).\n- Checklist appliquée et explicite (Go/Clarify/No-Go).\n- Zéro re-saisie des données déjà présentes.\n- Résultats jugés fiables et exploitables dès la première relecture.\n\n### 2.4 Novel UX Patterns\n\nLe cœur reste **familier** (CLI + commandes guidées), avec une innovation légère : un run unique qui orchestre tout et propose la “next best action”. Pas de pattern radicalement nouveau, mais une combinaison fluide et rassurante.\n\n### 2.5 Experience Mechanics\n\n**1. Initiation**  \nCommande simple (`run` ou alias), avec un prompt clair et des options minimales.\n\n**2. Interaction**  \nLe système collecte les sources, applique la checklist, prépare CR/anomalies, et affiche la progression.\n\n**3. Feedback**  \nMessages courts, état visible, et recommandations d’action (corriger, valider, envoyer).\n\n**4. Completion**  \nSorties prêtes à usage (CR, anomalies) + récapitulatif des actions effectuées.\n\n## Visual Design Foundation\n\n*Note : ces fondations visuelles s'appliquent aux sorties basées sur templates existants (CR/PPT/anomalies) et a la documentation, sans personnalisation visuelle hors template.*\n\n### Color System\n\n**Thème : Pro-Calme (bleu/gris)**  \nPalette de base orientée confiance et calme, avec une accentuation claire des états.\n\n- **Primary** : bleu profond (confiance, stabilité)\n- **Neutrals** : gris neutres clairs/foncés pour hiérarchie lisible\n- **Success** : vert doux (validation, “tout est OK”)\n- **Warning** : ambre discret (attention sans stress)\n- **Error** : rouge contrôlé (clarté sans agressivité)\n\n### Typography System\n\n**Pairing recommandé : IBM Plex**  \n- **Monospace (CLI / outputs)** : IBM Plex Mono  \n- **Sans (docs / reporting)** : IBM Plex Sans  \nHiérarchie simple, lisible, professionnelle, avec un ton sobre.\n\n### Spacing & Layout Foundation\n\n- **Densité respirée** : lignes et blocs bien séparés pour éviter la fatigue cognitive.\n- **Base spacing** : échelle 8px (ou équivalent dans le rendu doc).\n- **Hiérarchie claire** : titres, sections, listes, et états facilement repérables.\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n\n- Contrastes élevés pour lisibilité en terminal et dans la doc.\n- Couleurs d’état doublées par libellés explicites (pas de dépendance au seul code couleur).\n- Taille de texte confortable pour lecture prolongée.\n\n## Design Direction Decision\n\n### Design Directions Explored\n\n- Guided Run (calme, progression claire)\n- Split View (contrôle + preuves visibles)\n- Minimal Batch (vitesse maximale)\n- Template Studio (structure et templates)\n- KPI Snapshot (confiance via indicateurs)\n- Gentle Coach (guidé, rassurant)\n\n### Chosen Direction\n\n**Direction 1: Guided Run (Calm Focus)**  \nUne interface centrée sur un run guidé, avec progression visible, feedback concis, et “next action” explicite.\n\n### Design Rationale\n\n- Alignement direct avec les émotions cibles : contrôle, confiance, soulagement, efficacité.\n- Favorise un “happy path” clair et réduit la charge mentale.\n- Compatible avec utilisateurs CLI novices à intermédiaires.\n- S’inscrit dans le pattern “run unique” défini comme interaction signature.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- Pipeline de run en 4 étapes (collecte → checklist → génération → review).\n- États visibles + feedback court (OK/Warn/Error).\n- “Next action” systématique en fin de run (ex: review, send, export).\n\n## User Journey Flows\n\n### 1) Run quotidien complet (collecte → checklist → CR → review)\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[Start: tf run --daily] --> B[Collect sources Jira/Squash/Excel]\n

FR6 : Génération brouillon stratégie de test\n- FR7 : Propositions de cas de test (nominaux, variantes, limites)\n- FR8 : Édition et validation avant publication\n- FR9 : Intégration checklist ESN\n\n### Journey Patterns\n\n- **Pattern “Run + Next Action”** : chaque flow se termine par une action recommandée.\n- **Pattern “Check → Generate → Review”** : logique standard de qualité.\n- **Pattern “Fallback Graceful”** : dégradé via CSV/import quand APIs indisponibles.\n\n### Flow Optimization Principles\n\n- Réduire la saisie manuelle (zéro double saisie).\n- Afficher l’état et la progression à chaque étape.\n- Erreurs actionnables avec proposition de recovery.\n\n## Component Strategy\n\n### Design System Components\n\nSystème d’interaction CLI “custom léger” basé sur patterns éprouvés :\n- Command prompt + help contextuel\n- Progress indicator (étapes + %)\n- Status line (OK / WARN / ERROR)\n- Summary block (résumé des actions)\n- Next-action suggestion\n\n### Custom Components\n\n#### Run Pipeline Summary\n**Purpose:** synthèse du run (collecte → checklist → génération → review)\n**States:** running / success / warning / error / degraded\n**Interaction:** affiche la prochaine action\n**Degraded Mode Display:**\n- Indicateur visuel `[DEGRADED]` en orange si une source est en fallback CSV\n- Liste des sources OK vs fallback (ex: `Jira: OK | Squash: CSV fallback`)\n- Message explicite : \"Mode dégradé actif – certaines données proviennent d'imports manuels\"\n\n#### Checklist Result Panel\n**Purpose:** Go/Clarify/No-Go + raisons  \n**States:** success / warning / error  \n**Variants:** par périmètre / lot\n\n#### Anomaly Draft Template\n**Purpose:** standardiser les anomalies  \n**Content:** contexte, repro, preuve, impact  \n**Interaction:** validation avant publication\n\n#### Evidence Linker\n**Purpose:** lier preuves SharePoint ↔ tickets  \n**States:** linked / missing / error  \n**Interaction:** propose correction si lien manquant\n\n#### Report Output Preview\n**Purpose:** aperçu CR/PPT avant export  \n**Interaction:** quick review + edit\n\n#### Ticket Picker\n**Purpose:** sélection rapide par périmètre/lot  \n**Interaction:** recherche instantanée type fzf\n\n#### Diff/Delta Viewer\n**Purpose:** afficher ce qui a changé depuis la dernière exécution  \n**Interaction:** focus sur écarts clés\n\n#### Error Recovery Card\n**Purpose:** diagnostic + action recommandée  \n**States:** recoverable / blocked\n\n#### Config Validator\n**Purpose:** vérifier sources/credentials avant run  \n**Interaction:** liste de checks + statut\n\n#### Export Router\n**Purpose:** choix rapide format + destination  \n**Variants:** md/csv/ppt + SharePoint/Outlook/local\n\n#### Dry-Run Preview\n**Purpose:** simuler les actions avant exécution\n**Interaction:** affiche l'impact sans modification\n\n#### Privacy & LLM Mode Indicator\n**Purpose:** afficher le mode de traitement IA et le niveau de confidentialité actif\n**States:** local / cloud-anonymized / disabled\n**Display:**\n- `[LLM: LOCAL]` en vert – traitement 100% local\n- `[LLM: CLOUD ✓]` en bleu – cloud avec anonymisation active\n- `[LLM: OFF]` en gris – mode sans IA\n**Interaction:** visible dans la status line pendant les opérations IA\n**Couvre FR28-FR31 du PRD :**\n- FR28 : Anonymisation automatique visible\n- FR29 : Mode LLM local clairement identifié\n- FR30 : Journalisation sans données sensibles (implicite)\n- FR31 : Gestion secrets (configuration, pas UX directe)\n\n#### Test Design Assistant Panel\n**Purpose:** guider la conception de cas de test assistée par IA\n**States:** loading / draft-ready / validated / exported\n**Content:** stratégie de test, cas nominaux, variantes, limites\n**Interaction:** édition inline + validation avant export Squash\n**Couvre FR6-FR9 du PRD**\n\n### Component Implementation Strategy\n\n- Standardiser tous les composants avec les mêmes patterns d’état.\n- Messages courts et actionnables, cohérents avec le ton “calme/pro”.\n- Utiliser les tokens de la fondation visuelle (couleurs états + typo).\n\n### Implementation Roadmap\n\n**Phase 1 (core)**\n- Run Pipeline Summary (avec mode dégradé), Checklist Result Panel, Summary block, Next-action suggestion.\n- Privacy & LLM Mode Indicator (visible dès le premier run).\n\n**Phase 2 (ops)**\n- Evidence Linker, Anomaly Draft Template, Report Output Preview.\n- Test Design Assistant Panel (conception assistée FR6-FR9).\n\n**Phase 3 (power)**\n- Ticket Picker, Diff/Delta Viewer, Error Recovery Card, Export Router, Dry-Run Preview, Config Validator.\n\n## UX Consistency Patterns\n\n### Button Hierarchy (CLI Actions)\n\n- **Primary action** : commande directe (ex: `tf run`)\n- **Secondary action** : option explicite (ex: `--review`, `--export`)\n- **Confirmation** : uniquement pour actions irréversibles (ex: `--publish`)\n- **Default** : toujours visible et sûr (no destructive by default)\n\n### Feedback Patterns\n\n- **Success** : message court + résultat (OK)\n- **Warning** : cause + action recommandée\n- **Error** : diagnostic + “next best action”\n- **Info** : état ou progression sans bruit\n\n### Form Patterns (Prompts & Inputs)\n\n- Prompts courts, un par ligne\n- Valeurs par défaut visibles\n- Champs requis explicités\n- Validation immédiate avec message correctif\n\n### Navigation Patterns\n\n- Commandes hiérarchiques : `tf <module> <action>`\n- Help contextuel : `tf <module> --help`\n- “Next action” proposé en fin de flow\n\n### Search & Filtering Patterns\n\n- Sélection rapide type fzf\n- Filtres par périmètre / lot / statut\n- Résumé de sélection avant exécution\n\n### Additional Patterns\n\n**Empty States & Loading**  \n- État vide explicite + action possible  \n- Chargement : étapes visibles et durée estimée\n\n**Errors & Recovery**  \n- Diagnostic en 2 lignes max  \n- Option de replay  \n- Mode dégradé proposé si API indisponibles\n\n## Responsive Design & Accessibility\n\n### Responsive Strategy\n\n- **Desktop-first** : usage principal sur poste de travail (terminal).\n- **Mobile/tablette hors scope** pour l’interface CLI.\n- Pour la doc/outputs web, priorité aux écrans ≥ 1024px.\n\n### Breakpoint Strategy\n\n- CLI : non applicable (terminal).\n- Docs/rapports web : breakpoint principal à 1024px+, avec fallback simple pour écrans plus petits.\n\n### Accessibility Strategy\n\n- **WCAG AA** pour documentation et outputs.\n- Contraste élevé et états visibles sans dépendance à la couleur.\n- Navigation clavier complète (par définition en CLI).\n\n### Testing Strategy\n\n- Vérifier contrastes (AA) pour outputs/doc.\n- Tests de lisibilité en terminal (thèmes clairs/sombres).\n- Tests clavier & copie/collé sur outputs.\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\n- Messages courts, hiérarchie claire.\n- Couleurs d'état doublées par libellés.\n- Éviter les symboles ambigus sans texte.\n\n---\n\n## Revision History\n\n| Date | Version | Changes

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

It handles project configuration, integration endpoints (Jira, Squash), template paths, and LLM settings.\n\n## Usage\n\n```rust\nuse std::path::Path;\nuse tf_config::load_config;\n\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let config = load_config(Path::new(\"config.yaml\"))?;\n\n    println!(\"Project: {}\", config.project_name);\n    println!(\"Output folder: {}\", config.output_folder);\n\n    // Check for optional warnings using pattern matching\n    match config.check_output_folder_exists() {\n        Some(warning) => eprintln!(\"Warning: {}\", warning),\n        None => println!(\"Output folder exists\"),\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n## Configuration Schema\n\n```yaml\n# Required fields\nproject_name: \"my-project\"\noutput_folder: \"./output\"\n\n# Optional: Jira integration\njira:\n  endpoint: \"https://jira.example.com\"\n  token: \"your-api-token\"  # Sensitive - redacted in logs\n\n# Optional: Squash integration\nsquash:\n  endpoint: \"https://squash.example.com\"\n  username: \"user\"\n  password: \"pass\"  # Sensitive - redacted in logs\n\n# Optional: Template paths\ntemplates:\n  cr: \"./templates/cr.md\"\n  ppt: \"./templates/report.pptx\"\n  anomaly: \"./templates/anomaly.md\"\n\n# Optional: LLM configuration\nllm:\n  mode: \"auto\"  # auto | local | cloud\n  local_endpoint: \"http://localhost:11434\"  # Required when mode is \"local\"\n  local_model: \"mistral:7b-instruct\"  # Optional: model name for local LLM\n  cloud_enabled: true  # Required when mode is \"cloud\"\n  cloud_endpoint: \"https://api.openai.com/v1\"  # Required when mode is \"cloud\"\n  cloud_model: \"gpt-4o-mini\"  # Required when mode is \"cloud\"\n  api_key: \"sk-your-key\"  # Required when mode is \"cloud\" - Sensitive, redacted in logs\n  timeout_seconds: 120  # Optional: request timeout (default: 120)\n  max_tokens: 4096  # Optional: max response tokens (default: 4096)\n```\n\n### Cloud Mode Requirements\n\nWhen using `mode: \"cloud\"`, the following fields are **required**:\n- `cloud_enabled: true` - Must be explicitly enabled\n- `cloud_endpoint` - The cloud LLM API endpoint URL\n- `cloud_model` - The model name to use\n- `api_key` - Your API key for authentication\n\n## Error Handling\n\nThe crate provides detailed error messages with field names and correction hints:\n\n```rust\nuse tf_config::{load_config, ConfigError};\n\nmatch load_config(Path::new(\"config.yaml\")) {\n    Ok(config) => { /* use config */ }\n    Err(ConfigError::FileNotFound { path }) => {\n        eprintln!(\"Config not found: {}\", path.display());\n    }\n    Err(ConfigError::MissingField { field, hint }) => {\n        eprintln!(\"Missing field '{}'. Expected: {}\", field, hint);\n    }\n    Err(ConfigError::InvalidValue { field, reason, hint }) => {\n        eprintln!(\"Invalid '{}': {}. Expected: {}\", field, reason, hint);\n    }\n    Err(e) => eprintln!(\"Error: {}\", e),\n}\n```\n\n## Security\n\nSensitive fields (tokens, passwords, API keys) are automatically redacted in debug output:\n\n```rust\nlet config = load_config(path)?;\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", config);  // Shows [REDACTED] for sensitive fields\n```\n\nUse the `Redact` trait for explicit redaction in logging:\n\n```rust\nuse tf_config::Redact;\n\nif let Some(jira) = &config.jira {\n    // redacted() returns a String with sensitive fields masked as [REDACTED]\n    println!(\"Jira config: {}\", jira.redacted());\n}\n```\n\n## Validation\n\nThe crate validates:\n- Required fields are present and non-empty\n- URLs have valid format (scheme + host)\n- LLM mode is one of: auto, local, cloud\n- Local LLM endpoint is provided when mode is \"local\"\n- Template paths have valid format (non-empty, no null bytes)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/edouard/test-framework/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
