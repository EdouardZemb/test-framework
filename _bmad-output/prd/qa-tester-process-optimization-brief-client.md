Client-Facing Brief: QA Tester Process Optimization (TRA)
Version: 1.0
Date: January 29, 2026

1) Executive Summary
This brief presents an improvement initiative for QA tester workflows within the TRA context. The focus is on increasing process quality and reliability, reducing cognitive load, and improving reporting consistency, while keeping the existing toolset (Jira, Squash, Excel, PPT, Outlook, Teams, SharePoint).

2) Why This Matters
Current workflows rely on manual data transfers between tools, variable ticket quality, and high reporting effort. These factors reduce reliability and create unnecessary risk for test outcomes and stakeholder visibility. A more standardized and traceable process improves confidence, clarity, and decision-making.

3) Objectives
Primary
- Improve quality and reliability of preparation and reporting processes.
- Standardize the way test inputs and outputs are handled.

Secondary
- Reduce mental load and repetitive manual work.
- Improve traceability of tests, evidence, and anomalies.

4) Scope (Phase 1)
In scope
- Ticket readiness and testability qualification
- Estimation and strategy validation
- Standardized anomaly reporting
- Daily and weekly reporting consistency

Out of scope (Phase 1)
- Full automation of test execution
- Tool replacement or migration
- Contractual process changes

5) Key Challenges Observed
- Ticket descriptions often lack clear acceptance criteria
- Reporting requires manual copying and reformatting from multiple tools
- Anomaly descriptions are inconsistent in format and detail
- Reporting effort is high and varies by workload

6) Expected Benefits
- More reliable test planning and execution
- Faster and more consistent reporting
- Clearer anomaly documentation for analysis and fix cycles
- Reduced risk of errors due to manual data transfer

7) Proposed Direction (High-Level)
- Introduce a testability checklist to ensure ticket readiness
- Formalize validation of test strategy before design
- Define a single source of truth for reporting metrics
- Auto-populate daily and weekly reports where possible
- Standardize anomaly templates and evidence linking

8) Success Indicators
- Higher % of tickets passing readiness checks before estimation
- Reduced manual data entry points per report
- Improved consistency of anomaly reports
- Lower reporting error rate and improved timeliness

9) Open Questions
- Availability of API/export access for Jira and Squash
- Acceptance of automated or scripted reporting support
- Ownership for template and standard approvals

10) Next Steps
- Confirm constraints and access (APIs, exports, macros)
- Agree on checklist, templates, and validation flow
- Pilot on 1–2 perimeters before wider rollout
